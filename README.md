# Open Manual of Markdown Style

An open access manual of markdown style for academic publishing. Developed by the [Dialoa](https://github.com/dialo) team and
[philosophie.ch](https://www.philosophie.ch/ueberuns/das-team). 

See the [manual webpages here](https://dialoa.github.io/open-manual-of-markdown-style/). 
The manual's source (in markdown and using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org)) will be made 
open in the future.

## Short presentation

This manual's aim is to make markdown-based publishing available to
academic teams with no advanced technical knowledge. It is written 
as we develop a markdown-based workflow to publish 
the academic journal Dialectica. See the manual itself for more
details.
