# The Open Markdown Manual of Style

A manual of style for scholarly publishing. Open because it focuses
on software and open-access publications. Markdown manual of style
because it is written in markdown and for markdown-based production.

## Presentation

The OMMS aims to make markdown-based professional-quality publishing
available to academic teams with no advanced technical knowledge. It
explains how to convert manuscripts into, or author them as,
markdown documents, and turn them into beautifully typeset outputs
in multiple print and digital formats. 

No prior knowledge of markdown is required; authoring and
copyediting can largely be done using visual tools. Production,
however, realistically requires some technical knowledge (CSS for
web output, LaTeX for print output). 

## Status

The manual is a work in progress. It is used to produce the
open-access philosophy journal [Dialectica][] and compiles the
solutions we've adopted to deal with a range of typesetting
problems. It is fairly extensive but far from complete.
