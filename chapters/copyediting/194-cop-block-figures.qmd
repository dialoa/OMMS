# Figures (images, diagrams, graphs)

Figures are images, diagrams, graphs and the like. They can be *inline* or
*floated* or *annexed*.

* *inline*: the figure is *in the flow of text* as a block between two 
  paragraphs or as an inline element within a paragraph. It does *not* have
  a title or caption and cannot be cross-referenced. 
* *floated*: the figure has a title or caption and can be cross-referenced.
  It appears *around* a certain point in the text, but its position is not
  guaranteed to be exactly where you expect it. This improves typesetting
  in PDF output, as the PDF engine has more freedom to reflow paragraphs.
* *annexed*: the figure is placed at the end of the article. On a webpage,
  it can be shown on the side of the text.

Authors tend to overuse inline figures. They are appropriate for small
figures that do not deserve a title. Bigger figures should be inserted as
floats. 

When using floated figures, rephrase the text if needed to cross-reference them 
instead of assuming they appear where you insert them. That is, replace
sentences like "For illustration, see the following:" with "For illustration, see
Figure `@fig:figure1`".

There are two ways to provide figures: as separate files or within the 
markdown manuscript itself. 

* *Inline* and *annexed* figures can be provided as separate files 
  or as code in markdown.
* *Floating* figures must be provided as separate files.

For figures provided as files, the preferred formats are:

* TikZ/LaTeX format for vector images encoded in LaTeX (requires *Imagify* filter)
* SVG format for vector images,
* PNG or JPEG format for bitmap (aka raster) images.

Depending on your template, PDF image files may not work well with
output formats other than PDF. 

The difference between vector and bitmap images is explained in section @sec-vector-bitmap. 
In short,
vector formats are preferred for diagrams, plots, and the like. Bitmap images
for photos, fine-grained instrument outputs (e.g. brain scan), 
artistic drawings, and the like. 

__Prefer vector formats__ for diagrams, schemas, etc. They scale better and
are more precise. Vector images can be made with graphics editors (e.g. Inkscape) or 
generated from code, e.g. TikZ in LaTeX.

__Prefer TikZ/LaTeX__ if the author can provide the code. Using TikZ/LaTeX generates vector 
images using the journal templates' own fonts. (*Requires*: imagify filter)


## TikZ figures

*Requires*: Imagify filter.

### Inline TikZ figures

Simply insert TikZ code in the manuscript, within a `imagify` Div:

~~~ markdown

``` imagify

\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\begin{tikzpicture}[...options...]
  ... code ...
\end{tikzpicture}

```
~~~

### Floated TikZ figures

Save the TikZ code as a separate file with `.tex` or `.tikz` extension: 
(which one makes no difference):

__figure1.tikz__

``` latex
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}
\begin{tikzpicture}[...options...]
  ... code ...
\end{tikzpicture}
```

In the manuscript, insert an image link. 

```
See @fig:myfigure for an example.

![Caption of the figure.](figure1.tikz){#fig:myfigure}

Manuscript text resumes here.
```

See @sec-floated-figures below for details.  It must be on a line of its own, 
surrounded by blank lines, and with a caption text:

## Figures from files

To insert a figure from a file you use the markdown image command. Whether it 
generates an inline figure or a floated figure depends on how you use it, so
we explain that command first.

### Markdown image command

The image command is like the link command but preceded with `!`:

```
![alt text](file.jpg "title of the image")
```

As with links the source can be provided separately instead:

```
![alt text]

[alt text]: file.jpg "title of the image"
```

If the alt text is long, you can supply a shorter handle to 
provide the source separately:

```
![alt text that is very long because it is the caption of the image.][img1]

[img1]: file.jpg "title of the image"
```

In this command:

* `file.jpg` is the name of the file. It should be present in the folder. 
  If it is in another folder give a path: `path/to/file.jpg`. 
* `alt text` is the *alt text*. Originally, it is text that is meant *replace*
  the image for visually impaired readers and when the image file is missing, 
  on webpages. But it becomes the image's *caption* if it is treated as a floated figure.
* `title`, called the *title*, is optional text that is typically displayed
  when hovering above the image on webpages. It is not displayed at all
  in PDF output.

__Inline or Floated__. An image command is:

* A *floated figure* if it is on a single line, separated by blank lines, and with
  a non-empty alt text,
* An inline figure otherwise. 

__Attributes__. You can add attributes to an image command. This is used to specify
is width, height and a id for cross-references:

``` markdown
![alt text](file.jpg){width=50% #fig:fig1}

![other alt text]{#fig:fig2}

[other alt text]: file2.jpg
```

### Inline figure from a file

If you do not separate the image common from the surrounding text by blank
lines, the image will be mixed with the text itself:

``` markdown
The image below:
![](file.jpg "a nice cat picture")
will be printed in the middle of a line of text.
```

In most cases, you want to separate it. You should then make sure you
leave the alt text empty, otherwise the image will be treated as a
floated figure:

``` markdown
The image below:

![](file.jpg "a nice cat picture")

is separated from the text above and below.
```

Note that you cannot cross-reference inline figures.

### Floated figure from a file {#sec-floated-figures}

Insert an image command on a line of its own, surrounded by blank lines:

```markdown
![Caption of the figure.](file.svg 'optional hovering text')
```

You can add attribute to specify a width or height and a id for cross-reference:

```markdown
Previous text... See @fig:figure1.

![Caption of the figure.](file.svg){#fig:figure1 width=50%}
```

## Background on vector vs bitmap formats {#sec-vector-bitmap}

(Skip this section if you are familiar with the distinction). 

What's the difference between vector and bitmap image files?
[Bitmap (a.k.a. raster) images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) 
are encoded as a grid of pixels. [Vector
images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) are encoded as mathematical 
descriptions of lines and curves. For instance, a vector image may be (the
computer-language equivalent of) "draw a circle of radius 10mm around the coordi
nate (0,0)." The bitmap equivalent would be a big grid with cells coloured to
form a circle. Because of this, vector images *scale perfectly* and *magnify perfectly*. Bitmap images can get noisy and pixelated when scaled or magnified. 
See below if you can tell which is which: 

![Vector image](vectorVSbitmap-vector.svg){width=40%}
![Raster image](vectorVSbitmap-bitmap.png){width=40%}

As you can see, the vector (first one) looks smooth when magnified, the bitmap
looks pixelated. 

Why use vector images for diagrams? They're much better quality and use much less
space. A bitmap diagram easily looks pixelated in print or on a high-resolution
screen; it'll look unprofessional to the reader. Bitmaps in high resolution
*can* look good even in print or when enlarged on a screen, but at the cost
of using a lot of space: a 1920*1080 high resolution bitmap easily takes about
1000 times the space of vector version of the same diagram; an article with
bitmap images can easily occupy the same space as 10 to 100 articles without.
It's only in the case of highly textured images (e.g. photos) that a vector 
version would be either impossible or much heavier than a bitmap.

Which file types are vector, which are bitmap? 

* JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF: bitmap images.
* PDF: can be bitmap, vector, and even images combining the two. The only way to
tell is to zoom in a *lot* and see whether the lines remain perfect (vector) or
pixelate (bitmap). File size is also an indicator: vectors are hardly more than 
a few Kbs, bitmaps can be anything from a few Kbs to one Mb or so.
* SVG: vector. Exception: an SVG file can import bitmaps from other files, 
  including by URL. So in principle an author could send you a SVG 'conversion'
  that is nothing else than a link to an online version of their image. You're
  very unlikely to encounter that problem, but if in doubt: the SVG file is a 
  text file, you can open it in a text editor. Look for the tag `<image`
  , e.g. `<image href="mybitmap.pgn" width="200px"/>`. 

How to convert a bitmap image to a vector image? It can't really be done.
The problem is that the computer has to guess from the pixel grid of a bitmap
image what's supposed to be a line, a curve, etc. and that requires some 
intelligence (think of it like this: we're going from a limited resolution to
infinite precision). This is called *vectorizing*  the bitmap image. Software
like Inkscape can try and  vectorize images for you, but you have to fiddle with
the settings for each specific image, and the results are rarely satisfactory.
In most cases, your or the author will have a much easier time *recreating* 
the image in vector mode. If you want to try to vectorize anyway, search "vectorize
an image in Inkscape" or  "convert an image to SVG" online to find some tutorials. 

## How to create or convert images

### Prefer vector formats for figures

Diagrams, figures and the like should be provided in *vector graphics* 
formats (SVG files or code or TikZ code in 
LaTeX). Only photos, hand-drawn illustrations and the like should be provided
as *bitmap* (a.k.a. *raster*) files. If you're not familiar with the difference,
see the explanation below. 

If an author provides a diagram in bitmap form we ask that they recreated it in
a vector format. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is an
open-source, free software to generate vector images that is fairly easy to use
and powerful. Authors who write in LaTeX may try to create in using the TikZ 
package instead.


### How to create a vector image?

How to create a vector image? Draw it in an editor, or code it in TikZ. 

* Drawing in a vector graphics editor. Wikipedia has a [list of visual
  graphics editor]. Fully-featured editors will cover all needs but
  may require more work. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) is the best
  open-source one; Adobe Illustrator a good propertary one. However
  for simple diagrams you may be able to get by with a quick-and-dirty 
  online editor. There are quite a
  few of those; try `online svg editor` in a search engine (check 
  whether you need to pay to save your file). At the moment        
  [DrawSVG](https://www.drawsvg.org/) seems good (easy to use, free and no 
  registration, ads).


TikZ diagrams. [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ) is 
a language to describe vector images that can be embedded in LaTeX. It's 
powerful but has a very steep learning curve. 
If authors can provide them, TikZ 
diagrams are the best - because any text in those diagrams will be printed out
in the  journal's own fonts. TikZ code can be included directly in the markdown.
Our template will include them directly in the LaTeX/PDF output and convert them
to SVG files for other output formats. 

How to create a TikZ diagram? Typically the author needs to go through the 
(large) TikZ documentation and work from existing examples. But there is also
an [online visual editor (TikZit)](https://tikzit.github.io/) that can help.  

### How to modify a bitmap image

Wikipedia has a [list of bitmap image
editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_raster_graphics_editors). 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is the best open-source editor. Adobe Photoshop
and Photoshop Elements is a good commercial one, photography-oriented.  

### Figures with letters or text

Figures often include letters or text. They look best if their fonts are 
consistent throughout your journal. It is desirable, but not mandatory, your
house template fonts. If these can be freely distributed you could ask 
authors to install them and use them, but that's a tall order. 
It'll typically fall on you to apply house fonts if possible. 

* Figures in TikZ code: automatic. TikZ specifies the text, not the fonts, 
  so your house template will render the figures with your house fonts.
* Figures in SVG. Use a good editor like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) 
  with the house fonts installed on your computer. Open the file, select
  text elements, change their font. It should be quick. Exception: in some
  rare cases, the original files may have encoded the characters as 
  complicated lines rather than characters proper; if so the editor won't
  recognize them as text and change their font. If so your only option 
  would be to remove the original text and recreate it: it is probably
  more time-costly than it's worth. 
* Figures in bitmap format: can't realistically be done. Editing in a 
  bitmap editor is possible but probably more time-costly than it's worth.
  If you're settling for a bitmap you're already tolerating low quality
  anyway. 

### Removing large margins in SVG files

If the author provides you with a SVG file that has too much whitespace around, resize it using Inkscape. 

* open the file in Inkscape
* select all the content with the arrow tool (click on the top left, drag your mouse to form a rectangle around it). Note: you could try Edit > Select all (Ctrl+A on Win, Cmd+A on MacOS) but this sometimes take the entire page, even if it has a lot of whitespace. 
* Go to File > Document Properties. In the "Custom Size" area, expand the "Resize page to content..." line.
* Make sure "Units" is "px" (pixels). Enter 20 (20.00000) margins everywhere. If you activate the lock icon, you only need to enter 20 in one of the margins and the others will be the same.
* Click "Resize page to drawing or selection". You should see that the page limits are just around the drawing. 
* Close the "Document properties" box and save the document.

## Troubleshooting

### [WARNING] Could not convert image...

If you insert an SVG image file in markdown and generate a PDF output, Pandoc needs to convert it to a format that LaTeX understands. It does so using an external programme, `rsvg-convert`. If `rsvg-convert` is not present, you will get a warning: `[WARNING] Could not convert image...: check that rsvg-convert is in path`.

*Solutions*

1. Convert the SVG files to PDF using Inkscape. They will still be vector file and print out well, but the LaTeX engine that generates your PDF output will be able to insert them. Open the file(s) in Inkscape, go to File > Save a copy, select the "Portable Document Format (pdf)" format, save. In your markdown code replace `ImageFile.svg` with `ImageFile.pdf`. 
2. Install `rsvg-convert`. As far as we can tell the least difficult way to do this is to use package managers. On Linux look for rsvg-convert in your package manager. On MacOS you should install `homebrew` first, if you haven't already, and run the command `brew install rsvg-convert`. On Win you should install the `chocolatey` package manager, open an administrator Powershell (Windows menu > Windows Powersheel > right click on Powershell and select "Run as Administrator", give the permission) and run the command `choco install rsvg-convert`. 

Note: on Windows Pandoc 2.14.0.3 (June 2021 version) cannot handle SVG conversion, even if `rsvg-convert` is installed. If that's your setup use the first solution.
