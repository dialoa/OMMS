# Bibliography

You should get or create a bibliography file contained the references cited
in your manuscript. This could be a BibTeX file (`.bib`) or a CSL json file 
(usually `.json`). You need to:

1. Get or create a bibliography file
2. Check whether the file includes any self-cited entries. Some bibliography 
  entries may cite other entries, so the bibliography file will cite its own 
  entries. We need to ensure that any such self-cited entry is actually present
  in the file, and we need to ensure that it is printed out in the bibliography.
3.

*dialectica*. We use BibTeX files. The "bibliography file" below refers to a 
`.bib` file in your article's folder. 

## Important

* Use **different names** for the BibTeX files of different articles in
  the same issue. If one journal issue has several `.bib` files with
  the same name, the second won't be found. (*dialectica template*)
* Your BibTeX file may 'self-cite': entries that cite other entries
  (in the `note` field, or even in the `title` field.)
  You need to check that (a) all entries cited in that way are included
  in the Bibfile. If they aren't you'll see "Citation not found" errors.
  You also need to check that (b) all citations within the bibliography
  are printed correctly. Look at the bibliography in PDF and html
  output, make sure it doesn't contain garbage like **Smith_2008:c?** 
  or wrong formatting like "(reprinted in (Smith 2008))".

There's more detail on self-citing bibliographies below.

## Get or create a BibTeX file

**Temporary solution**: get your .bib from Philipp. 


## Adding non-cited references in the bibliography

In the metadata block, add a line:

``` yaml
nocite: |
  @bibtexentry1, @bibtexentry2, @bibtexentry3
```

If you have lots of those, best use a tool to extract the keys
automatically from a bibtex file.


## Inserting Citations in the text in RStudio

**Requires:** RStudio visual editor mode.

In **visual** mode, Insert \> @ Citation. It opens a popup window; on
its left menu, choose bibliography. Click the plus sign on the right of
each citation, then press the insert button.

**Missing references**: Go to @ Citations. On the left menu of the pop-up
window, choose CrossRef. (See image below). Type the author and the name
of the paper in the search bar; that should find the paper. Click on the
plus sign on the right of the entry, then press insert button which will
add the reference to the bibliography file.

## Formatting citations in the text

There are various formats of citations:

-   In several recent papers, this has all been shown wrong (Castor
    > 2018; Pollux 2020).

-   As Castor (2020: 127) shows, this is all wrong.

To get these various formats you need to modify the markdown code for
citations. For instructions refer to the Markdown guide above
(cheatsheet or section on citations).

## BibTeX file guidelines

This only applies to BibTeX (`.bib`) files. If you're using CSL Json files, 
you are probably generating them from Zotero or some other bibliography
manager instead. 

### Edit BibTeX files

Several methods:

1. Edit the `.bib` file directly in a text editor (e.g. RStudio). Either:

  i. fix manually what is wrong with the entry. 
  ii. delete the entry, search and add it again with the same method as 
    when you miss a reference (see below).

2. Use a BibTeX editor (BibDesk, comes with TeXshop on Macos, or JabRef).

3. Use a bibliography manager like Zotero that imports / exports BibTeX files.
  **Beware**: Zotero and others convert the `.bib` file into their own 
  formats on import. This means that you may lose of your bib file's 
  features: with Zotero, `\cite` commands (that a BibTeX file may use to 
  cite some entries in other entries) are lost.
  
### Check BibTeX file formatting

You can use `biber` (LaTeX's bibliography generator) to check 
a BibTeX file for errors. Run on the terminal:

```
biber --tool references.bib
```

This prints out a report on any problem in the file. It also
creates a cleaned-up version of the file, as 
 `references_bibtools.bib`.
 
### BibTeX field names aren't case-sensitive

BibTeX field names are not case-sensitive: they can be named "author",
or "Author", or "AUTHOR".

```bibtex
@inbook{Jakobson:1980,
  Author = {Jakobson, Roman},
  Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}
}
```

Is the same as:

```bibtex
@inbook{Jakobson:1980,
  author = {Jakobson, Roman},
  TITLE = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}
}
```

### Title capitalization

Traditionally, in English bibliographies titles in English are typeset in *title 
case* ("An Article with Results") but titles in other languages are typeset in
*sentence case* ("An article with results"). In German or French bibliographies,
all titles (including those of works in English) are in sentence case.^[The 
Chicago manual recommends title case for English titles; the APA manual 
recommends sentence case for all titles.]

The appearance is controlled by our bibliography template. For this to work
entries in the the BibTeX file must:

1. Have a `langid` field specifying the entry's language 
  as an [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag): 
  `en`, `en-US`, `de`, etc.^[The [polyglossia package 
  documentation](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/polyglossia) has a useful
  list of tags. If you have a full LaTeX installation you can also get it from 
  the terminal by running the command `texdoc polyglossia`.] Though (at least 
  some) full names like `english` or `french` will work too. If there is no  
  `langid` field for a given BibTeX entry,  the entry is assumed to 
  be in the language of the  document (as specified in the document's metadata, 
   `lang` field).
2. Have titles in *sentence case*, that is, where only names and words that need
  to be capitalized no matter what are in upper case. For instance, "The 
  philosophy of logical atomism" or "Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den 
  formalisierten Sprachen". 

If an entry uses title case ("Rezension der Schrift von..."), the 
capitals will be assumed to be mandatory and will be printed even
when it should be in sentence case. Thus if you know that your bibliography
entries in English will always be printed in title case (i.e., your publication
is in English and you're sure it won't adopt the APA sentence case convention),
then it's harmless to use title case in the BibTeX file itself. But when in 
doubt sentence case + `langid` field is the safe option. 

For an illustration: 

```bibtex
@article{Tarski1936,
	author = {Alfred Tarski},
	title = {Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen},
	journal = {Studia Philosophica},
	volume = {1},
	pages = {261--405},
	year = {1936},
	langid = {de},
}
@article{Russell1905,
	author = {Bertrand Russell},
	title = {On denoting},
	journal = {Mind},
	volume = {14},
	number = {56},
	pages = {479--493},
	year = {1905},
  langid = {en},
}

```

For more detail:

* the `langid` field is a [`biblatex` field 
  name](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex). It is recognized by Pandoc's 
  `citeproc` (Pandoc's internal citation processor) for use in a association 
  with a CSL style file. 
* There is a `language` field in BibTeX files too. But it is not meant to affect
  an entry's format; rather, it is used for entries to explicitly
  state its language](ttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/323441/how-does-langid-field-in-biblatex-differ-from-language-field)
  affect the formal of the bibliography.

### Original year of publication

If the author isn't using the original edition of a book, e.g. citing
from a 2010 edition of Locke's 1689 essay, add a field origdate in the
bibtex entry. (will not show up in the PDF at the moment, but our final template
will do it). Ex:

```bibtex
@inbook{Jakobson:1980,
  Author = {Jakobson, Roman},
  Booktitle = {The Framework of Language},
  Location = {Ann Arbor},
  Year = {1980}
  Origdate = {1956},
  Pages = {81\--92},
  Publisher = {University of Michigan Press},
  Shorttitle = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem},
  Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}
}
```

See [biblatex documentation, §2.2.2 on data
fields](http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex/biblatex/biblatex.pdf).

### BibTeX conventions and resources

There are two BibTeX standards that can be used:

* BibTeX
* BibLaTeX

The two conventions overlap a lot (most of the field names are common).
The BibLaTeX conventions are more recent and complete. The BibTeX ones are 
widely used, and almost entirely compatible with BibLaTeX. 
Each corresponds to a LaTeX bibliography processor (`bibtex` and `biber`, 
respectively). Both are understood by Pandoc's bibliography processor, `citeproc`. 

Where to find references on these BibTeX standards?

1. BibTeX. The [BibTeX original documentation](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) (1988), Paperpile's [BibTeX guide](https://www.bibtex.com/format/).
2. BibLaTeX. The [BibLaTeX official documentation](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) and the 
[BibLaTeX cheatsheet](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex-cheatsheet).

Note: if you have a full LaTeX installation on your computer you will have 
access to some of these documents from your terminal using the `texdoc` 
command. Try the commands:

```bash
texdoc biblatex

texdoc biblatex-cheatsheet

texdoc bibtex
```

**Dialectica guideline**. We use the `biblatex` conventions. 

## BibTeX file special entry types

### Unpublished manuscript

Choose the type `unpublished`. Add a note field:

```bibtex
  note = {unpublished manuscript}
```

Add a URL if available.

*Dialectica guideline*. We require a URL. If the author cannot provide a URL, we
do not create a bibliography entry at all but only describe the source in a 
footnote ("in an unpublished manuscript titled "XXX").

## Make sure any self-cited entries are included and printed

Your bibliography file may be 'self-citing', that is it may
include some entries that cite other entries. For instance, a bibliography entry may have the title "Review of `\citet{Smith_h:2005}`", where the latter is LaTeX
code to cite the entry with key `Smith_h:2005`. If your bibliography file might have such entries you need to do two things:

1. Make sure that for all the self-cited keys, there is an entry in the file.
2. Make sure that the self-cited keys are printed out in the final bibliography. 

If somebody else is taking care of your bibliography file, you only have to 
do the second. If in addition you're sure that your bibliography file does *not*
include unnecessary entries, you have a simple way of dealing with (2) by 
adding the `nocite: @*` line in your metadata. See below. 

### Check that the BibTeX file includes all self-cited entries

**Requires:** Dialectica's `selfcites.py` script. Using the terminal.

*The problem*. If a bibliography file self-cites some keys, but doesn't include
an entry for these keys, you will get "Missing reference" warnings and your 
bibliography will be incomplete. You need to ensure that there's an entry for
any self-cited key. 

*Solution*. Run the selfcites.py script on your bibliography file. Suppose your article's bibliography file is named `myreferences.bib`. Open a terminal, navigate to the article folder and run:

```bash
python3 ../../../resources/scripts/selfcites.py myreferences.bib
```

More generally, you can run that script from anywhere on a bib file that is anywhere:

```bash
python3 path/to//selfcites.py path/to/myreferences.bib
```

The script will check the `.bib` file for self-citations and output a report in the terminal such as:

```
Dialectica open access initative self-citing bibliography file check, (c) Thomas Hodgson 2021
I found these self cited keys:
 quine:1951e, loux:1970, lewis_dk:2001c, vaninwagen:2001, quine:1953, lewis_dk:1983
These self cited keys are missing from the file's entries:
 quine:1951e
loux:1970
lewis_dk:2001c
vaninwagen:2001
quine:1953
lewis_dk:1983
For information, these are all the entries I found:
 horgan_te-potrc:2008, brenner_and:2017a, zimmerman_dw:2008, kleinschmidt_s:2014, sider_t:2013, rettler:2016, vaninwagen:1998d, cameron_rp:2012, lewis_dk:1973, cowling_s:2013b, finocchiaro_p:2019:, burgess_jp-rosen:1997, mcsweeney:2019, willard_mb:2014, bennett_k:2009, nolan_dp:1997b, tallant:2013a, schaffer_j:2015a, prior_an-fine:1977, turner_j:2015, churchland_pm:1984, finocchiaro_p:2021:, melia:2008a, quine:1948, torza:2015, schaffer_j:2009d, lewis_dk-lewis:1970, bennett_k-zimmerman:2013, linnebo-nicolas:2008, lewis_dk:1986, parsons_j:2014, chalmers_dj-etal:2009, sober:2015, sider_t:2011, merricks:2001, keller_ja:2017, finocchiaro_p:2019b:, mckay_tj:2006, paul_la:2017a
```

If there are keys below "These self cited keys are missing from the file's entries:", then your .bib file cites these keys but they are missing. You need
to add them. 

The line below "I found these self cited keys:" can be used to ensure the
self-cited entries are printed in the article bibliography. See [below](#add-self-citations-to-your-documents-metadata). 

### Make sure all the self-cited entries are printed out

*The problem*. If bibliography file self-cites some entries, but the manuscript
itself doesn't cite them, these entries will not be printed in the bibliography.

*The solution*. The self-cited entries must be added in the document's metadata, 
in a `nocite` field. There are two ways to do so:

* if you're sure that your .bib file *only* contains entries that need to be 
printed out (no extra entries), then you can use the simple option 1.
* otherwise, use option 2, which requires a script.

Option 1. If you are sure that your .bib file *only* contains entries that need to be printed out in the bibliography

**Requires:** the selfcites.py script. See [above](#check-that-the-BibTeX-file-contains-self-cited-entries).


Open the `.bib` file in a text editor. Search for `\cite`. If you have no 
no results, then your `.bib` file doesn't include self-citations and you 
are good to go. If you do find results, you will have bibliography entries 
in the file that look like this, for instance:

```bibtex
@book{geach_pt:1962,
  address =       {Ithaca, New York},
  author =        {Geach, Peter Thomas},
  note =          {third edition: \citet{geach_pt:1980}},
  publisher =     {Cornell University Press},
  title =         {Reference and Generality, an examination of some
                   medieval and modern theories},
  year =          {1962},
}
```

In the `note =` line here, you see the code  `\citet{geach_pt:1980}`. This is 
a LaTeX command that cites *another bibliography entry in the same file*, namely
the one with the key `geach_pt:1980`. Ultimately this will be printed out in 
the bibliography as: 

> Geach, Peter Thomas (1962) *Reference and Generality, an Examination of Some Medieval and Modern Theories*, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. Thrid edition: Geach (1980).
>
> ...
>
> Geach, Peter Thomas (1980) *Reference and Generality*, ...

The LaTeX `\cite` commands can start with `\cite`, `\citet`, `\citep`; you will
find all of these by searching `\cite` in the file. Sometimes the command cites
pages numbers and looks like this instead:

```bibtex
  note =          {reprinted in \citet[232--258]{mccall_s:1967}, with
                   considerable change in notation},
```

In that case the cited entry's key is still the thing between curly brackets,
here `mccall_s:1967`.

Now you need to make sure that the self-cited entries appear in the bibliography.
The problem is that if it is only cited in the bibligraphy and not the paper 
itself, it will not automatically be included. To ensure that it is included, 
you need to add the key in your document metadata, in a `nocite` field:

```yaml
title: A Neat Paper
author: Smith, John
bibliography: smith.bib
nocite: |
  geach_pt:1980, mccall_s:1967
```

The `nocite: |` should appear on one line, the entries on one or several lines
below but each of those lines must start with at least two spaces, and the
entries should be separated by commas. 

You need not check whether the entries are actually cited in the paper or not:
just add them to the `nocite` metadata, it will not hurt if they are also cited.

Continue searching for `\cite` commands in your `.bib` file and make sure all
the keys are entered in your document's `nocite` metadata section. 

## Troubleshooting and examples

### Error message: Unexpected end of file

The following message indicates an error with the BibTeX file:

```
Error at "percent.bib" (line 9, column 1):
unexpected end of input
```

### Percent signs in DOI field

At the moment % signs in DOI fields generate an error. 

If you copied/pasted DOIs in your BibTeX file, symbols in 
them may end up 'percent-encoded', e.g. "%2F" instead of "/".
For instance, the DOI "10.1007/15.12345" copied from
the web may end up being pasted as "10.1007%2F15.12345".

These DOIs crash Pandoc version 3.0.1 and lower, but the
bug will be fixed in future releases.


### Error message: `\citet` unknown command

**Requires:** script or filter that manages recursive bibliography management .

Pandoc encounters a LaTeX citation command (`\citet` or the like). Unless you
or the author has written one in the text, it is in the .bib file.^[Explanation.
By default Pandoc doesn't process the `\citet` command in a bib file (at least, not if 
the field is "title", and perhaps not in general), leaves the `\citet` command.
At the LaTeX stage it's not recognized by LaTeX (because we don't load natbib).]

Solution 1. In Dialectica, LaTeX citation commands in the .bib file are processed. This is achieved by a script that runs pandoc on the document twice,
first to generate a json that includes the biblio, second to generate the final 
output (at which state the latex commands in the biblio are processed). The
first run is `--to json` and the second with `-M suppress-bibliography`. 
Suggested by John MacFarlane on pandoc-discuss. 

Solution 1. Replace the offending `\citet` command(s) in your .bib file. To find it or them:

* process the markdown with .tex output.
* search \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in.
* go to the .bib file and replace the `\citet{jones_a:2020}` in that entry with e.g. `Jones (2020)`, and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above)

Solution 2. Implement a double-pass generation procedure. This is the publisher's
job.

::: private
We have now figured out a method to process those command. However, we'll need
to update the document-generation procedure to implement it. Either wait for it,
or use solution 1.

in a field of your .bib file is printed out. It needs to be replaced. To find it:

* process the markdown with .tex output.
* search \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in.
* go to the .bib file and replace the `\citet{jones_a:2020}` in that entry with e.g. `Jones (2020)`, and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above)

Explanation. Pandoc doesn't process it (at least, not if the field is "title", and perhaps not in general), leaves the `\citet` command. At the LaTeX stage it's not recognized by LaTeX (because we don't load natbib).

### From Frege to gödel

Mystery. The cross ref below is printed out as "From Frege to gödel: "
by citeproc, no matter (a) whether we write `Gödel` or `G{\¨o}del`, (b) no
matter the position, i.e. we get "From gödel to Frege". **The solution
is** put G in curly brackets. But why???

```bibtex
\@incollection{frege:1967a,
  Author = {Frege, Gottlob},
  Crossref = {vanheijenoort:1967},
  Note = {translated by Stephan Bauer-Mengelberg},
  Num_Sort = {40337},
  Pages = {1\--82},
  Title = {Begriffsschrift: A Formula Language Modeled on that of
  Arithmetic, for Pure Thought},
  Year = {1967}
}

\@book{vanheijenoort:1967,
  editor = {van Heijenoort, Jan},
  year = {1967},
  title = {From Frege to G{\"o}del: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic
  1879-1931},
  booktitle = {From Frege to {G}ödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic
  1879-1931},
  address = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},publisher = {Harvard University
  Press}
}
```

Beginning of an answer: case is protected if a *subpart* of the word is bracketed. `A dog called {Pizza}` will be overriding by the style (and thus printed "A pizza" if the style calls for it) but `A dog called {P}izza` is 
protected.
