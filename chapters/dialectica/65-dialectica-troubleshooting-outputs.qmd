## Cannot run pandoc-crossref because it is not from a trusted developer

MacOS-specific error. Solution: close the alert---don't chose "Move to
Bin"! In Finder, go to the `template/X.X/filters` folder, where X.X is
the latest version of the template. ⌘-click the file `pandoc-crossref`
(not `pandoc-crossref.exe` nor `pandoc-crossref-nix`). Chose "Open". You
will get the same alert but this time with the option to Open: select
it. Nothing will happen but after that the system will trust the file
and you'll be able to generate outputs.

## HTML empty or PDF with cover only

The maker hasn't find your article source. You probably forgot to update
the master file's `imports` list with your source file name.

## WARNING: pandoc-crossref was compiled with pandoc X.X.X but is being run through Y.Y.Y etc.

Ignore this if the first two digits X.X and Y.Y are the same, e.g.
"pandoc 3.1.2 but is being run through 3.1". It's small mismatch between
the Pandoc version and the cross-references filter's version, normally
harmless. You may remind the workhouse administrator to update the
cross-references filter, or check that your pandoc is up to date.

If the Y.Y number is 2 or more lower than the X.X, e.g. "pandoc 3.4 but
being run through 3.1" then you need to update your Pandoc.

## Error message about Stix TWO

PDF-specific. Means that you haven't installed the Stix Two font.

## Error: PDF output not produced

Pandoc can't generate a PDF. There are, unfortunately, many reasons why
this can happen. Essential background first: PDF generation happens in
two stages:

1.  Pandoc converts Markdown to LaTeX.
2.  A LaTeX engine converts LaTeX to PDF.

First we need to check that no crash occurs at stage 1.

-   Check first that you can generate a HTML of the article. If not, you
    have first to fix the error in HTML generation. See
    [@sec-house-outputs-html-errors].

-   Then generate a LaTeX file for the article.
    [@sec-house-outputs-rendering-commands]

If Pandoc generates HTML and LaTeX with no crash, then the error happens
at the LaTeX stage.

Typical causes for a LaTeX-stage error are:

-   Typos in a math formulas.

-   An author's LaTeX uses some packages or defined commands. These need
    to be provided to the article as `header-includes`. (Though
    sometimes you need to tell the author to simplify their LaTeX
    first!)

-   Raw LaTeX code, either from the author or from you (e.g. added to
    handle fine-grained spacing) doesn't work correctly

-   An author's LaTeX code doesn't interact well with our template.

-   there's a bug in our filters or our template

To make progress you should look for the LaTeX error message. It's
displayed in the output when Pandoc fails to produce a PDF. It is on a
line that starts with `!`, such as:

```         
! Undefined control sequence.
l.512 \llbracket
          
[1{/usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]
(./smith_j.aux))
(see the transcript file for additional information)
... 
(more text)
...
```

Or:

```         
! LaTeX Error: File `image.png' not found.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.618 \includegraphics{image.png}
                        
[1{/usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]
(./test.aux))
... 
(more text)
...
```

Note that you can get the log as a text file in two ways:

-   Run the command to generate the pdf but add `2> out.log` at the end,
    e.g. `make off1pdf 2> out.log`. This will save the log as out.log.

-   Run the LaTeX engine on the LaTeX file itself. Make sure you've
    generated a LaTeX file (`.tex)` and that you have a terminal localed
    in that folder. Run:

    `lualatex --interaction=nonstopmode smith_j-2020.tex 2> out.log`

    adapting to your LaTeX file name. If you omit
    `--interaction=nonstopmode` the engine will instead stop at any
    error encountered and ask you what to do; you can enter "x" for
    exiting. (You can also enter "i" for ignoring the error, but
    typically that generates further errors down the line, and anyway
    all LaTeX errors have to be fixed before final output.)

-   If you run the LaTeX engine you'll get a few 'artefact' files:
    `<article-name>.log` , `.synctex`, `.aux`. You can later erase them;
    try the command `latexmk -C <article-name>` (assumes you have
    `latexmk` in your LaTeX installation), otherwise erase them but
    remember to keep your source file `.md` and any `.bib` files!

The file `out.log` is a plain text file, you can open it for inspection
in any simple editor and you can send it by email for help.

Even if you don't know LaTeX, you can glean some pointers form the LaTeX
error message.

-   The line number (e.g. `l. 618`) is the line number *in the LaTeX
    file*, not in your source markdown file. Generate the LaTeX output
    (if it's not already done) and go to that line in it: you'll
    probably be able to figure out which part of the article is
    generating the error. Note however that it's not a sure shot: LaTeX
    error at a line are sometimes due to issues much earlier in the
    document.

-   Error messages are often followed by a line split in two, as in:

    ```         
    ! Undefined control sequence.
    l.618 $\binom{n}{k} = \fract
                            {n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
    ```

    This means LaTeX crashed just before the split. Here the split
    occurs between `\fract` and `{n!}`, so LaTeX crashed at `\fract`.
    Often that is where the error is: the correct command for fractions
    is `\frac` not `\fract`. Again, it's not a sure shot: LaTeX error at
    a line are sometimes due to issues much earlier in the document.

If that doesn't help solving the issue, you can still try the
time-consuming method below. Otherwise get help from somebody who's more
familiar with LaTeX or the journal's template coder. Tell them what
article generated the error, and copy-paste or attach the error log (or
at least the part where the error message is).

A last resort. More time-consuming but guaranteed result. Isolate the
error. Make a copy of your file and trim it down until you can generate
a PDF, as follows:

-   Disconnect the bibliography file. In the metadata block, put a `#`
    in front of the bibliography line:

    ```         
    # bibliography = smith-paper-references.bib
    ```

    This deactivates the line. Try producing a PDF; if you don't get the
    error, you know that the source is something in your bibliography
    file. Otherwise continue.

-   Isolate the error by halves. Remove the second half of the document.
    Try producing a PDF. If you get an error, you know the problem is in
    the first half; divide it in two, repeat. When you get to the point
    where you don't get an error (at a given point), start re-adding
    parts of the text one by one, until you identify what addition
    generates the error.

-   In that process you may get "warnings" you didn't get before, e.g.
    because you've cut out the footnotes associated with a paragraph.
    Don't worry about them, they'll disappear once the relevant bits are
    re-added.

## Errors in HTML generation {#sec-house-outputs-html-errors}

Errors in HTML generation should arise from three possible sources only:

-   wrong formatting of the metadata block in your article source file.
    You will get a `YAML Parse error` or the like, possibly with a
    number indicating the line where Pandoc *thinks* the error is.

-   Error in the citation file. You will get a `Citeproc error` or the
    like, with possibly a number indicating the line in the `.bib` file
    where Pandoc *thinks* the error is.

-   bug in *Dialectica*'s template. You get a `Error running Lua filter`
    or the like. The error message may give you some clue as to which
    filter is improved.

    -   Email the template programmer. Include in your email: which
        source file generates the error, a copy/paste of the error.

    -   You can experiment to find more about the error. If it comes
        from a particular filter and your article sets options for that
        filter, you may try changing those options.

update the filename in `master.md` or `master-win.md` with your markdown
source file's name.

-   If you get a pdf file with a cover but no title or article content,
-   If it doesn't create an html, your pandoc is not updated. Ask us for
    help if needed.
-   If you get an error message about Stix TWO, you haven't installed
    the font in your computer. See above.
-   If you get an error message "Error: PDF output not produced", Pandoc
    is probably able to generate html and LaTeX output (you can test
    with the options above), but the conversion from LaTeX to PDF (done
    by a LaTeX engine such as pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex) fails. In
    those cases it's useful to use the `debug` option generated above.
    You will get a `.log` file that gives you more detail about the
    error. The file can be opened in RStudio and its structure is
    explained a bit in the\
    [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-outputs) section below.

## A brief guide on Pandoc's PDF output logs

When asking pandoc to produce a PDF you can produce an output log (see
the sections on generating outputs to see how to do this with RStudio or
the terminal).

The file begins with `[INFO]` messages about Pandoc's source to LaTeX
conversion. Typically this is just information about the \`filters' that
Pandoc runs, e.g.:

```         
[INFO] Running filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua
[INFO] Completed filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua in 70 ms
```

Then, `[makePDF]` messages about the commands Pandoc executes to launch
a LaTeX engine that converts the LaTeX to PDF. The "Command line" one
tells you which LaTeX engine is used, here `lualatex`:

```         
[makePDF] Command line:
lualatex "-halt-on-error" "-interaction" "nonstopmode" "-output-directory" "<TEMPDIR>" "<TEMPDIR>/input.tex"
```

The "Source" message copies the *entire LaTeX file* that Pandoc sends to
the LaTeX engine. It can be useful for a quick look, but it's more
convenient to generate that LaTeX file separately (see how above). When
you have LaTeX error messages that give a line number, that is the line
number in the LaTeX file (hence it's easier to find those when you open
the separate LaTeX file in a text editor with numbered lines.)

```         
[makePDF] Source:
% Options for packages loaded elsewhere
\PassOptionsToPackage{unicode}{hyperref}
\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}
\PassOptionsToPackage{dvipsnames,svgnames*,x11names*}{xcolor}
%
... % more LaTeX code
```

The LaTeX source is usually very long (200-500 lines + at least the
number of lines in your markdown source). To find the next section, you
can search for `[makePDF] Run` in the file.

The "Run" messages (`[makePDF] Run #1`, `[makePDF] Run #2`...) give the
LaTeX engine's output messages. Generating PDFs from LaTeX typically
requires several 'runs' of the LaTeX engine on the file: the first run
generates various bits stored in an auxiliary file (e.g., which page a
heading ends in, whether a citation is labelled Smith 2020 or Smith
2020a, ...) and the second run uses them to finalize the PDF. Under each
`[makePDF] Run #` you get the full *LaTeX Log* of the LaTeX engine. This
is where you'll find information, warnings and errors concerning PDF
generation. For instance:

```         
[makePDF] Run #1

The above is a LaTeX log of a file that converts into PDF without error.
The overal structure is:

-   PDF engine: `This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.13.0 (TeX Live 2021)`
-   Document class: `Document Class: scrbook...`
-   LaTeX packages used and their own messages: `(path/to/package.sty`.
    Here the package `Ustmaryrd` (a font collection) issues a warning
    that it's using a 5pt characters in the absence of 5.5pt characters.
    `input line 70` refers to the line in the LaTeX file.
-   pages generated: `[1] [2] [3] [4] ...` indicate that the
    corresponding page is "shipped out" (generated and saved into the
    PDF). This means we have no error or warning at pages 1 to 4, yay!
-   Underfull and overfull `\hbox` warnings, e.g.
    `Underfull \hbox (badness 2469)`. These indicate that LaTeX has
    generated a less-than-ideal horizontal line: an horizontal line with
    a bit too much, or not enough, text. Typically nothing to worry
    about: the text is just slightly more or less spaced than usual.
    However, very bad cases of overfull can be a table or long equation
    or image or some unbreakable large item that sticks out of your text
    block. The easiest is to check for them visually in the PDF output,
    but if you are after perfection you can check all the ones mentioned
    in the log. To know which pages they're on, look for `[n]` page
    shipout indicators before and after the overfull message.
-   If compilation runs without error, the end messages. These includes
    the warning if a LaTeX rerun is needed
    (`LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may   have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.`),
    which you don't need to worry about because Pandoc takes care of
    this, and statistics about the output
    (`Output written on input.pdf (18 pages, 113569 bytes).`)

If the PDF building from LaTeX has failed, you will see LaTeX error
messages. For instance:

```         
! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.6 
    
!  ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
Transcript written on dummy.log.
```

The error message starts with `!`, followed by a (more or less useful)
description of the message, and an excerpt of the LaTeX code before and
after the error occurred, and the line the engine was processing when
the error occurred. Here the error was a missing `$`: in LaTeX `$` is
used to surround mathematical formulas, and each 'opening' dollar sign
must be matched with a 'closing' one. The error was produced as the
engine was processing line 6.

*Important*. The line *at which the error occurred* is not necessarily
the line *where the mistake is*. For instance, with matching `$` the
error is at the point where the engine realizes that the number of `$`
isn't matched. But typically the *mistake* was earlier on, where a `$`
sign should have been.

To diagnose and solve LaTeX error you need knwoledge and experience of
LaTeX, which is beyond the scope of this guide. It often helps to make
an internet search on the error message text.

## pandoc says "Error"unknown option "citeproc""

Your need to update pandoc to a newer version. "Citeproc" (the pandoc
extension that prints bibliographies, and replaces BibTeX/BibLaTeX) is
only in versions \>2.11 (september 2020). How to update depends on how
you've installed it: download from pandoc page, or do brew --upgrade (if
you're using homebrew for MacOS), etc.

## pandoc says `pandoc: FILENAME: OpenBinaryFile: file not found`

`pandoc` doesn't find one of the files needed.

The instructions above work only if:

-   your execute the pandoc command while located in the folder that
    contains your markdown file and its bibliography while. (Learn how
    to navigate folders in the command line, and go where your markdown
    file is.)

-   that folder is located three folders down from the workhouse's base
    folder (the folder where the `processing`, `resources` folders are
    located). So your markdown file can be in:

-   `processing/2020-01-special-issue/01-michels`

-   `finished/2020-02-issue/01-elzein`

-   ...

The file `resources/defaults.yaml` contains our default settings for
pandoc, and they *also* assume that your file is three folder down from
the base. This is why we preface `resources/defaults` with `../../../`
in our `pandoc` command (to indicate that the file is three folder up
from where you are when you run `pandoc`).

If you want to run `pandoc` with our settings on a file that's located
elsewhere, you can use the full command. You can figure it out from
`resource/defaults.yaml`. At present this would be:

```         
pandoc --standalone --pdf-engine=xelatex --citeproc --csl=PATH/TO/dialectica.csl  --template=PATH/TO/dltc-template.tex SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf
```

\noindent but the details might change as we update our defaults. You
may add any additional option you wish. `PATH/TO/` should be replaced
with the path from your folder to the templates. For instance, if the
templates and style files are respectively in in:

-   `journal-new/design/templates`
-   `journal-new/biblio/`

and your manuscript is in:

-   `journal-new/articles/issue-01/`

You could try:

```         
pandoc --standalone --pdf-engine=xelatex --citeproc --csl=../../biblio/biblio-style,csl  --template=../../design/templates/dltc-template.tex SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf
```

That is, `../../` going two folders up (hence at `journal/new`) and from
there down `biblio` in one case and `design/templates` in the other.

You can also create your own defaults file `mydefaults.yaml` in a text
editor, with contents like:

```         
standalone: true
pdf-engine: xelatex
citeproc: true
csl: ../../biblio/biblio-style,csl
template: ./../design/templates/dltc-template.tex
```

Save it next to your manuscript and run `pandoc` with:

```         
pandoc -d mydefaults SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf
```
