## Title and subtitle

Here are the fields used to format titles and subtitles:

```yaml
title: Plain title here
subtitle: Plain subtitle here
shorttitle: Shorter subtitle for page headers
title-latex: |
  Title for the first page title \
  with possibly some linebreaks
subtitle-latex: |
  Title for the first page title \
  with possibly some linebreaks
title-cover: |
  Title for the offprint cover \
  with possibly some \
  linebreaks
subtitle-cover: |
  Subtitle for the cover
title-cover-size: \huge
subtitle-cover-size: \Large
```

All fields except `title` are optional. `shorttitle` is used for page headers 
and the table of contents. `title-latex` and `subtitle-latex` are used for
the title on the first page and `title-cover` and `subtitle-cover` are used 
for the offprint cover; they may include linebreaks as shown above. 
If `title-latex` is provided but `title-cover` is not, the former is used for
the cover too.

The offprint cover sizes are controlled by`title-cover-size`and 
`subtitle-cover-size`. Defaults is `\Huge` for titles of 30 chars or less, `\huge`
for longer titles, and `\LARGE` for subtitles. 

There is no control of the first page title and subtitle font sizes.
