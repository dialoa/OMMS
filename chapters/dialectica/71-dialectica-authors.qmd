# Author information

## Et al. author for page headers and table of contents

For articles with multiple authors, you may need a shorter 
alternative for page headers and the table of contents. 
This is done using the `author-header` and `author-toc` fields:

```yaml
author:
- name: Doe, Alice
- name: Doe, Brit
- name: Doe, Celia
- name: Doe, Denis
- name: Doe, Ethne
author-header: Doe et al.
author-toc: Doe A., Doe B., Doe C., Doe D., and Doe E.
```

## Multiple short institute names in the signature block {#sec-dial-multiple-short-institutes}

*Problem*. An author's affiliations consists of several short acronyms,
e.g. "CRNS, ENS, EHESS". If you enter them as three distinct institutes,
they each appear on a single line in the signature block at the
end of the article. This looks awkward. Treat them as a single institute
instead, using a list item (e.g. on a line starting with a `-`):

``` yaml
  institute:
  - ENS, CRNS, EHESS
```
