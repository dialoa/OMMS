# Abstracts

Abstracts are strongly recommended. Most people who bump on the article will only read that. 

Abstracts are text-only, no markdown code, because they are passed on to Crossref and metadata harvesters. However, we can allow emphasis and equations.

## Length

Abstracts must be at most 200 words or so and fit in the first article's 
page in PDF output. 

## Citations

Citations in abstract should be plain text, not markdown: Doe (2005), not [@Doe2005].
