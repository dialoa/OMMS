# Cover note

You may add a brief cover note to an article, e.g. to state that 
an article is posthumous or give an acceptance date. 
It is displayed:

- in PDF offprints: on the cover, below citation data.
- in HTML offprints: below the citation data and abstract.

Enter it in the article metadata under 'cover-note' or 'covernote':

``` yaml
title: My article
subtitle: or how I wrote something
cover-note: |
    Article accepted for publication despite the reviewer's
    significant doubts.
```
