# Article structure

## Appendices

In *Dialectica* articles, appendices are normal sections. Just prefix the heading with "Appendix:".

``` markdown

# Appendix: Uniqueness Theorem {#sec:app-uniqueness-theorem}

```

If an article has several appendices, put them as subsections of an "Appendices" section:

``` markdown

# Appendices {#sec:appendices}

## Uniqueness Theorem {#sec:app-uniqueness-theorem}

```
