# Bibliography

## Bibliography files

We use BibTeX bibliography files (`.bib`).

To be checked: it is ok to use the same bibliography file name for
several articles in the same issue?

## Interface with dialectica's main bibliography

More information on the bibliography is in the bibliography-section of
the overleaf-document.

JD some experiments:

-   Tried simply adding the main bib file (biblio-check.bib) as the
    > bibliography file of an article in RStudio. Problems:

    -   It takes circa 15-30sec to 'Read the bibliography" when opening
        > the article, and 10-20sec again when opening the
        > insert-citation window.

    -   But the bibliographies entries don't show up in the
        > 'Bibliography' tab.

    -   It looks as if either RStudio can't read it (bug / unusual code
        > somewhere?), or just gives up above a certain number of
        > entries


JD thought: We need either:

-   some way of either generating a sub-selection of the main
    > bibliography for the article. Automated? Something like Sandro's /
    > crossref bibtex convertor, but for this bibliography? (Suggestion:
    > linking via DOIs?)

-   Some way of having the main biblio as one of the source in RStudio
    > citation-insertion popup, the way Zotero appears. However: risk
    > that it is slow because of the size.

-   Some way of *searching* the main biblio as one of the sources in
    > RStudio, the way CrossRef appears in the citation-insertion popup.
