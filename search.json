    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nThis book is an open manual of style for scholarly publishing using markdown. Open because it focuses on open-source software tools and is targeted at open-access publishers. Of markdown style because it combines style and technical advice for producing professional-quality publications using markdown. The manual itself is open-source, open-access and written in markdown.\n\nPresentation\nThe OMMS aims to make markdown-based professional-quality publishing available to academic teams with no advanced technical knowledge. It explains how to convert manuscripts into, or author them as, markdown documents, and turn them into beautifully typeset outputs in multiple print and digital formats.\nNo prior knowledge of markdown is required; authoring and copyediting can largely be done using visual tools. Production, however, realistically requires some technical knowledge (CSS for web output, LaTeX for print output).\n\n\nRelation with Quarto\nThe OMMS overlaps with, and complements, the excellent Quarto documentation.\n\nThe OMMS focuses on copyediting and production. It is aimed at small publishing outfits rather than authors - though you can use it to write a thesis.\nThe OMMS gives prescriptive style and typesetting advice. It’s a manual of style rather than technical documentation.\n\n\n\nStatus\nThe manual is a work in progress. It is used to produce the open-access philosophy journal Dialectica and compiles the solutions we’ve adopted to deal with a range of typesetting problems. It is fairly extensive but far from complete.\n\n\nEdit the guide\nYou’re welcome to edit the guide. To do so:\n\nInstall Quarto. Some package managers have it (brew install quarto on MacOs, choco install quarto on Windows, but not on Linux.) See 30  Dialectica new house style outputs on package managers.\nOpen the guide folder in RStudio (or Visual Code, if you use Quarto with that).\nChapters are listed in _quarto.yaml . If you create a new chapter you need to add it here.\nChapter files are in the chapters folder - obviously. Numbers in their names are for convenience: they ensure that chapters in the folder appear in the same order as they appear in the book.\nChapters can be edited in visual or source mode. They’re “Quarto markdown” (.qmd) files but that’s just like Pandoc markdown.\nTo render a chapter open and it and use Render &gt; Render HTML. You’ll see the output in RStudio’s preview pane.\nTo render the whole book Build &gt; Render Book or open the index.qmd file and do Render &gt; Render HTML.\n\n\n\nCredits and license\nDeveloped by the Dialoa team and philosophie.ch.\nCopyright 2021-23 Julien Dutant\n This work licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.",

    "text": "4.3 New Workflow Start [Draft]\nNote: below, when saying “in a terminal”, we mean either PowerShell on Windows, or your default terminal in Mac or Linux. All of the commands provided should work in all PowerShell (Windows), zsh (Mac) and bash (Linux).\nThe association is setting up a standardized compilation environment for Dialectica. The environment is encapsulated in a docker container and includes all of the tools needed for the copyediting work, including pandoc, LaTeX, Quarto, and the fonts. The idea is that you will only need to interact with the container in your local machine, as if it was a “box” containing the Dialectica copyediting tools, without needing to install each tool separatedly.\nIn this way, all of the copyeditors can share a single complete environment (i.e., the versions of all of the tools used by the team will be the same), minimizing compiling problems and compatibility issues. This also allows for issues to be fixed in a centralized manner, as new versions of the environment (with fixed issues) will affect everyone.\nFollow the steps here everytime you want to start working using the Dialectica compilation environment. This section assumes you have already set up your machine as explained in Chapter 30.\n\nFirst make sure that docker is running. In a terminal, do:\ndocker ps\nIf there are no errors, then docker is running. If not, try the following to start docker:\n\nOn Windows and Mac, open Docker Desktop, and make sure that the “whale” icon appears in your tray\nOn Linux, in a terminal, do sudo service docker start\n\n\n\nWait until docker starts, and do docker ps again.\n\nIn the output of docker ps you should see a container with the name dltc-env running.\nIf you opted to stop the container last time you were working, then you won’t see it in the output and you need to start it up again:\ndocker start dltc-env\nStart VSCode, select “Remote Explorer” on the vertical toolbar to the left, select “Dev Containers” on the dropdown menu above, then hover above “compilation-env” and click on the arrow next to it. You can now “Open Folder” and choose “dltc-workhouse”, which is the same folder you have in\nDropbox.\n\n\nAll set, you’re ready to work. Remember that you can open a terminal inside VSCode (in the menu above: Terminal &gt;&gt; New Terminal), which will give you a terminal inside the container. Here you’ll find all of the tools you need (pandoc, LaTeX, Lua, quarto, dltc-make, and the fonts).",

The first is easy if you’re not familiar with the terminal and allows you to do a bunch of manuscripts at once. The second is faster for a single manuscript once you’ve learnt how to do it.\n\n5.3.1 With the conversion box and RStudio\nRequires RStudio and a conversion-box folder at the root of journal’s working folder.\n\nDelete any manuscript already present in the conversion-box folder: Word files (.docx, .doc), LaTeX files (.tex), markdown or quarto files (.md, .qmd). This is a temporary folder, whomever left it there has made copies.\nCopy your original manuscript (MS Word, LaTeX) in the conversion-box folder. You can copy several if you want to convert multiple manuscripts in one go.\nRename the manuscript file(s) if necessary: manuscript filenames must not contain spaces, colons, question or exclamation marks.\nOpen conversion-box.Rproj in the conversion-box folder. This opens RStudio in the ‘conversion box’ project.\nIn RStudio, do Build &gt; Build All, or equivalently hit Shift-Ctrl-B (Win. Linux) or Shift-Cmd-B (Mac). This converts any MS Word or LaTeX file in the folder to markdown.\nCopy the resulting markdown file from the conversion-box to your article’s working folder.\n\n\n\n5.3.2 With Pandoc only\nOpen a terminal. If using RStudio or VSCode, there is a Terminal tab. This opens a terminal already located in your article’s working folder. If you’re opening a terminal from your system, you need to navigate (using cd, change directory commands) to your article working folder.\nIf you need help with using the terminal see section Appendix A.\nRun the following command:\npandoc -s original/manuscript.docx -o manuscript.md\n\noriginal/manuscript.docx is the path and filename of the original manuscript. Here I’m assuming that the submission is called manuscript.docx and placed in a folder original. On Windows we use backlash to mark folders so that would be original\\mansucript.docx instead.\n-o manuscript.md tells pandoc to convert to markdown (.md) and save the result as manuscript.md in your cuurent folder.\n-s, short for --standalone, tells Pandoc to produce a “standalone” document, i.e. include a header with any metadata it is able to extract from the source.\n\n\nFor instance, if your terminal was not located in your article working folder but in its original subfolder, and you wanted to write the result in the main sufolder (i.e. one folder up), you’d use instead:\npandoc -s mansucript.docx -o ../manuscript.md\n\nWhere ../ (..\\ on Windows) means “one folder up”.\n\n5.3.2.1 LaTeX manuscripts: check the bibliography field\nConverting from LaTeX is the same, but pay attention to the bibliography file location. The resulting markdown file may have a bibliography key:\nbibliography: original/references.bib\n\nbibliography: C:/Windows/Users/Zotero/references.bib\n\nUpdate these if needed. Here original is the subfolder for preserving the original: I should instead copy the .bib file to the main article folder and replace this key with bibliography: references.bib. The second one, C:/Windows... is a location in the author’s computer as it was cited in their LaTeX file, it should be removed.\n\n\n5.3.2.2 More options for Pandoc conversion\nSee Pandoc’s Manual: reader options for more options.",

A MS Word file contains information about font use and margin size, which the publisher must get rid of since they’re applying their own font and margins. It also typically fails to encode crucial information in in a machine-readable way. For instance, an author may:\nOur copyediting task is to remove unnecessary formatting, and turn important features into codes that the automatic processor can pick up and deal with.\nMarkdown is a light-weight, intuitive way of encoding meaningful features.

    "text": "6.3 What to encode\nWhen copyediting we need to decide which features of the original manuscript we want to keep, or encode, in our document. For instance, we don’t want to keep the author’s specific choice of fonts, or whether they italicize headings. But we do want to keep italics used for emphasis, or hyphens used to cut a word at the end of a line.\nThe goal is to encode non-stylistic features of the article, and those features only. The stylistic or merely presentational ones are handled automatically by your journal style.\nThe features we keep are encoded in markdown syntax. For instance, emphasis (italics) is encoded by enclosing words within asterisks:\nIn this sentence the last world is *emphasized*.\n\nWhen a feature is encoded, the journal’s template ‘understands’ it. This means that it’ll be able to typeset it correctly, according to the journal style, in all the outputs formats we need—PDF, webpage, ebook.\nHere’s a list of features we want to encode. The list is in progress: not everything we want to encode is handled by our template yet. An X under “syntax” means that there is markdown code (aka syntax) to encode the feature in question. An X under “implemented” means that our template is able to typeset the feature in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSyntax?\nImple mented?\nNote\n\n\n\n\nHeadings\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nParagraphs\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nFootnotes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nEmphasis (italics, bold)\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nSuperscripts and subscripts\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nCitations\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nCross-reference: heading\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nCross-reference: footnote\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nCross-reference: specific location\nYes\nNo\nMust be handled separately in PDF vs HTML.\n\n\nCross-reference: image, figure, table\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nCross-reference: theorem, statement\nYes\nYes.\n\n\n\nQuotations: block quotations\nYes\nYes\nEncoding the source too?\n\n\nQuotations: inline\nYes\nYes\nUnnecessary.

    "text": "6.4 About Markdown\nMarkdown is a syntax - a way of writing or encoding document. A markdown document is a plain text file that can be viewed in any text editor REWRITE THIS\nis a syntax enhanced plain text with machine-readable information, a.k.a. ‘markup’. More specifically, we’ll use pandoc’s Markdown - the variant of that syntax that is most suited to academic texts and that is fully understood by our automatic converter, pandoc.\nThe copyediting files we work on are thus in pandoc’s Markdown format (extension .md). These are just plain text documents, which can be edited with any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, …), but where we use a certain codes to encode information needed by our automatic document converter (pandoc). For instance, a document may contain the line:\n\n\nIn this article, I will prove that the *metaphysical* question is not nonsense.\n\n\nwhere the * encode the fact that the word “metaphysical” is emphasised. The automatic converter can pick up on that information and typeset the word accordingly in the PDF and HTML outputs. Typically, emphasized words are typeset in italics, but we could decide to typeset them with small caps or letter spacings as well. So we only encode the fact that the word is to be emphasized, using the * notation, and leave the rest to the converter.\nThe official documentation of pandoc’s Markdown can be used to supplement the instructions below.",

    "text": "6.5 RStudio visual markdown editor\nFor background see also Quarto’s page on RStudio visual mode.\nWhen you open a markdown file in RStudio, you’ll see Source and Visual tabs in the upper left corner. These are two different ways of visualizing the same document. The Source mode shows the document as it is, namely a plain text markdown file. The Visual mode shows the document as a webpage would display HTML code, or as a word processor like MS Word displays documents: text encoded with emphasis is shown in italics, text encoded as headings is shown in a larger font, etc.\nHere’s the Source mode:\n\n\n\nRStudio’s source mode (2023)\n\n\nHere’s the Visual mode:\n\n\n\nRStudio’s visual mode (2023)\n\n\nYou can switch between modes by clicking the ‘Source’ and ‘Visual’ tab. Exception: RStudio may refuse to switch to Visual if doing so would break down some elements in your document. (This is notably the case with numbered examples.)\nThe Visual mode allows you to edit without using markdown code. You can insert headings, italics, formulas, tables and so on by clicking in the menus. You can also insert more complicated structural elements, e.g. a Div with its id and attributes.\nThe Source editor shows you the markdown file as it is. There’s some syntax highlighting to help you visualize markdown codes.\nThere’s a useful “outline” button at the top left to see the headings of the document.\nYou can still type markdown in the visual editor—it’s usually faster to do so. Try it out: type ## Test at the beginning of a line and the line will be converted to a level 2 heading. You can type formulas, enter Divs and so on.1\nThe visual editor is good for initial copyediting (if your document allows using it): you’ll see the text and typos better. The source editor is good final copyediting and typesetting: you see the exact code used to generate your output and you fix special characters, line breaks, explicit LaTeX code and the like.",

    "text": "6.6 Heads up on special characters in markdown\nIn Markdown the characters below are sometimes have a special meaning:\n\\ & * $ [ ] _ @\nNormally, you shouldn’t have to worry about them. But if they aren’t visible or your markdown file generates error when turned into PDF, they may be the culprit. Typically the error can be avoided by ‘escaping’ the character, i.e. preceding it with a backslash. Hence:\n\\& means & (nb, mandatory in BibTeX files!)\n\\* means *\n\\\\ means \\\n\\$ means $\nEtc.\nThe one exception is the square brackets. Markdown syntax allows two ways of encoding math formulas: wrapping them in $ or wrapping them in parentheses or brackets:\n\n$...$ and \\(...\\) can be used to enter an inline formula\n$$...$$ and \\[...\\] can be used to enter a display (i.e. block) formula\n\n\nSo if you try to espace both an opening and a closing bracket, your markdown will be read as a math formula.\nHere are problem cases you might encounter:\n\nA reference cited is titled Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. You have the title with & in your BibTeX file, and it generates an error.\nThe problem is that in LaTeX/BibTeX & is a special character (to indicate tabs).\nSolution: ‘escape’ the ampersand in your BibTeX file:\n  title = {Fear \\& Loathing in Las Vegas}\nYour text has a pair of asterisks:\nPrinciple (*) is strong. Principle (*) is stronger than Principle (**). \nThe text between the asterisks is wrongly interpreted as emphasized:\n\nPrinciple () is strong. Principle () is stronger than Principle (**).\n\nSolution: escape the asterisks:\nPrinciple (\\*) is strong. Principle (\\*) is stronger than Principle (\\*\\*). \n\nPrinciple (*) is strong. Principle (*) is stronger than Principle (**).\n\nSquare brackets for elided texts in citations. In practically all cases they’ll be fine. The following markdown code will display as intended, for instance:\nThe [simple] models [...] are useful\nThere’s only trouble in a rare case: the elided text matches a section header. For instance, suppose you have:\nThe simple [models] are useful.\n\n## Models\nThis is wrongly interpreted as a link:\n\nThe simple models are useful.\n\nWhy? Pandoc automatically assign the header “Models” a link identifier: models (see the chapter on cross-referencing). And if this identifier is present, [models] becomes a link to it. And one of the section headings is “Models”.\nSolutions:\n\nIf you’re working in markdown code, leave it as is. We run pandoc with an option that disables these links.\nIf you’re working in the RStudio visual mode, add an identifier to the header, ## Models {#sec:models} (Pandoc) or ## Models {#sec-models} (Quarto)",

    "text": "8.5 Linebreaks: genuine, merely visual and explicit\nCan you spot the error in this metadata block?\ntitle: The Formalization of arguments with various\napplications\nauthor: Robert Michels\n\nThe problem is that the title is spread over two lines: it should either be all on one line or use the text block syntax (|).\nTo avoid such errors it’s important to distinguish:\n\nGenuine line breaks in your markdown file,\nMerely visual line wrapping, and\nExplicit line breaks to be printed out in your output\n\n\nAnd, to distinguish these, you need a text editor that displays line numbers—smart editors like VSCode, RStudio, Sublime etc. all do.\nA markdown file, like any text file, is simply a long string of characters. Most of them are letters, numbers and symbols. But some are linebreak characters: they denote the end of a line rather than a letter, number or symbol. Using ‘↩︎’ to represent this special character, a simple text file could be:\nnow then, let's go out↩to enjoy the snow... until↩I slip and fall!\n\nThis is how the computer ‘sees’ it. For us, though, it’s hard to read. So, your text editor displays these line breaks characters by starting a new line instead, which it indicates with a new line number:\n 1 now then, let's go out\n 2 to enjoy the snow... until\n 3 I slip and fall!\n\nThese are genuine line breaks, in the sense that they reflect what’s actually in the file.\nThere is no limit to the length of (genuine) lines in a file. For instance, a two-line file may be:\nthis file starts with a very very very very very very very very very very very very long line followed by↩a short one\n\nThe first line of this file is likely to be longer than the width of your text editor. If so, your editor faces a dilemma: should it show it to you as one line, in which case you’ll need to scroll to the right to read it? Or should it “wrap” the line, i.e. split it when it reaches the right end of the editor’s window, in which case what you see won’t exactly correspond to what’s in the file? Editors normally offer both options—usually in a menu called “View”: Wrapping, or No Wrapping.\nBut editors with line numbers give you the best comprise: they only have line numbers where there are genuine linebreaks. Without wrapping, they show you the file above like this:\n1 this file starts with a very very very very very very very very very very very very long line followed by\n2 a short one\n\nSo you see that there are only two lines; the first is long and probably overflows your editor’s window to the right. In Wrapping mode, depending on window size they might show the file as follows:\n1 this file starts with a very very very very very very very very \n  very very very very long line followed by\n2 a short one\n\nYou can see that the second line isn’t a genuine line break in the file because it doesn’t have a line number. It’s really the rest of the first line, merely displayed below it so you don’t have to scroll right to see it. By contrast, “a short one” is a genuine new line.\nBack to metadata blocks. In an editor with line numbers, you can see the difference between:\n1 ---\n2 title: The Formalization of arguments with various\n  applications\n3 author: Robert Michels\n4 ---\n\nand:\n1 ---\n2 title: The Formalization of arguments with various\n3 applications\n4 author: Robert Michels\n5 ---\n\nBoth try to provide the title: value in one line (they don’t use the | of text blocks). The first one is correct. As line numbers show, our title is indeed given in one line (line 2). The editor merely displays “applications” on a subsequent line, for our convenience. What’s really in the file, what the computer ‘sees’, is just one line. So, there’s no error there. In the second, however, we have mistakenly entered a genuine linebreak between “various” and “application”, as shown by the new line number 3. So, what the computer reads is:\n\nthe title is “The Formalization of arguments with various”\nthen there’s a line “applications”. It’s not a field name, because it’s not followed by a colon (it’s not: applications: ...). So, what is it?\n\n\nAnd you get a “YAML Parse error” message, which is to say that the computer doesn’t understand the structure of your metadata block.\nGenuine line breaks in your markdown files are not explicit line breaks, however. Recall the file containing Bashō’s haiku:\nnow then, let's go out↩to enjoy the snow... until↩I slip and fall!\n\nIt has three genuine line breaks, which your text editor will show thus:\n 1 now then, let's go out\n 2 to enjoy the snow... until\n 3 I slip and fall!\n\nIn markdown, however, linebreaks are just treated as spaces. So, if you create an output from this file, you’ll get a single paragraph:\n\n\nnow then, let’s go out to enjoy the snow… until I slip and fall!\n\n\nWhen turning markdown into PDF or HTML output, there’s no attempt to match the lines in your markdown file. That’s good because you normally don’t want to manually decide where to break the lines. The only thing you want to manually enter are the paragraph divisions, and these are just entered by two successive linebreaks, i.e. an empty line:\n1 This is a paragraph containing one or more\n2 sentences. Line breaks in the markdown file are\n3 treated as spaces, so the final output may\n4 break lines elsewhere than shown here.\n5\n6 However, it will treat this as a second paragraph\n7 because it is separated from the previous\n8 by a (genuine) empty line, i.e. two successive\n9 linebreaks. \n\nIn some cases though, like poetry verses, you want to specify explicit line breaks that aren’t paragraphs. These are entered by ‘escaping’ the linebreak character, i.e. having a backslash followed by the linebreak character. In the text editor:\n 1 now then, let's go out\\\n 2 to enjoy the snow... until\\\n 3 I slip and fall!\n\nWhich corresponds to the following file:\nnow then, let's go out\\↩to enjoy the snow... until\\↩I slip and fall!\n\nIn markdown, escaped characters are reproduced as they are. Thus an escaped linebreak is reproduced as an explicit linebreak in your output. Beware that the \\ should be immediately followed by the end of the line, not a space: otherwise it’s just an explicit space and all you’ll see in your output is an extra space.\nIn summary:\n\nMerely apparent linebreaks are lines starting with no numbers in your editors. They correspond to nothing real in the file; they’re just a convenient way of displaying a long line.\nGenuine linebreaks are linebreaks characters in the file, corresponding to new numbered lines in your editor. They are important in metadata block. In the main text, they are treated as spaces, so you can cut your lines whenever your lines. The exception is two linebreaks in a row, i.e. an empty line, which mean a new paragraph.\nExplicit linebreaks are backslash \\ at the very end of a line. They represent forced linebreaks that must be reproduced in the output.\n\n\nTerminological note: hard vs soft line wrapping. You may encounter the terms of “hard” and “soft” line wrapping. Here’s what they mean.\n\nHard line wrapping is entering genuine linebreaks. For instance, your editor may offer the option of reflowing your text with linebreaks at a certain fixed length. This will normally be in the “Edit” menu, as it changes the file itself.\nSoft line wrapping is merely displaying long lines on multiple lines. Text editors offer a soft wrapping option, which allows you to view long lines without having to scroll horizontally. This will normally be in the “View” menu, as it doesn’t modify the file itself but only how you view it.\n\n\nGeneral comment. The beauty of working with text files such as markdown files is that there is nothing hidden: what you see in the editor is exactly what there is on file. The only thing that’s not immediately obvious is genuine linebreak characters. Now that you know how to use an editor’s line numbers to identify them, markdown files have no secret for you.\nTo see what we mean by ‘hidden’, compare with Word files. When you see an italicized word fortiori in a MS Word document, what there actually is in your .docx file is a complicated bit of code such as this:\n&lt;w:r&gt;&lt;w:rPr&gt;&lt;w:i/&gt;&lt;w:iCs/&gt;&lt;w:lang w:val=\"en-US\"/&gt;&lt;/w:rPr&gt;&lt;w:t&gt;fortiori&lt;/w:t&gt;&lt;/w:r&gt;\n\nBecause you can’t see what’s going on ‘under the hood’ when you modify a file in MS Word, it’s virtually impossible to do proper typesetting. For that you’d need to see the file as it is; but as the example above shows, they’re virtually impossible to read when seen that way. Markdown gives us the benefit of working with a humanly readable file and at the same time working with the file exactly as the computer ‘sees’ it.",

    "section": "8.6 List and map values",
    "text": "8.6 List and map values\nIn addition to simple values like a piece of text or a number, a metadata field’s value can be a list or a map.\n\n8.6.1 Lists\nA list is a sequence of values. For instance, the keywords field is a list of text values:\nkeywords:\n- pleasure\n- pain\n- life\n- death\n\nEach item in the list is on a separate line, starting with a dash (-). The dashes are aligned with the field’s name (keyword here). Quotation marks can be used, as with one-line text values Section 8.2.1.\nAn alternative, shorter way to enter a list of one-line values is to use square brackets and commas, as in:\nkeywords: [pleasure, pain, life, death]\n\nThat is equivalent to the above; again quotation marks can be used. It cannot be used for more complex list values such as text blocks or maps.\nList items can be text blocks too, and you can mix text blocks and one-line values:\nkeywords:\n- |\n  A we\"ird key'word with:symbols\n- |\n  A keyword that I would like\n  to enter on multiple lines\n- this item is just a line\n\nA list item can also be a map. Let’s explain what these are first.\n\n\n8.6.2 Maps\nA map or dictionary is a set of field-value pairs. The metadata block itself is a map:\ntitle: The Meaning of Life\nauthor: Jane E. Doe\nbibliography: references.bib\n\nBut a field’s value can itself be a map. We indicate this by indenting the map under the field’s name. This is typically used to specify options for a template extension like Imagify (used to turned LaTeX into images):\ntitle: Yet Another Mistaken Theory\nauthor: Jane E. Doe\nimagify:\n  scope: all\n  output_folder: _imagify_outputs\nbibliography: references.bib\n\nHere imagify’s value is a map with two fields: scope and output_folder. Note how these entries are indented and below imagify. By contrast, bibliography is aligned completely to the left, with title, author and imagify, so it’s a main field, not a sub-field of imagify.\nSub maps can contains sub-sub maps and so on:\nfield1:\n  subfield1:\n    subsubfield1: value\n    subsubfield2: value\n  subfield2: value\nfield2: value\n\nAny of the values can be a list. If it is, align the list’s dashes with the field’s name. For instance, we can make the value of subsubfield1 a list of two values as follows:\nfield1:\n  subfield1:\n    subsubfield1:\n    - first value\n    - second value\n    subsubfield2: value\n  subfield2: value\nfield2: value\n\nA map cannot have two fields with the same name:\nBAD\n\nauthor: Jane Smith\nauthor: John Doe\n\nHowever, the same field name may appear in distinct maps, including a submap and the main map, or distinct maps in a list of maps.\n\n\n8.6.3 Maps in lists\nA list item can be a map. The author field is a case in point:\nauthor: \n- name: Vincent Conitzer\n  email: conitzer@cs.duke.edu\n  correspondence: true  \n  institute: Duke University\n- name: Nadine Elzein\n  email: nadine.elzein@warwick.ac.uk\n  institute: University of Warwick\n\nLet’s break this down. Our author field is a list of two values:\nauthor:\n- first value\n- second value\n\nEach of these values is itself a map. The second value is the following map, for instance:\nname: Nadine Elzein\nemail: nadine.elzein@warwick.ac.uk\ninstitute: University of Warwick\n\nWhen we insert it in the list, we make sure we indent the map so that each of its fields is aligned to the right of the -:\nauthor:\n- first value\n- name: Nadine Elzein\n  email: nadine.elzein@warwick.ac.uk\n  institute: University of Warwick\n\nNote how name, email and institute are all aligned, and to the right of the second dash. Doing the same with the map corresponding to the first value we obtain the desired result:\nauthor: \n- name: Vincent Conitzer\n  email: conitzer@cs.duke.edu\n  correspondence: true  \n  institute: Duke University\n- name: Nadine Elzein\n  email: nadine.elzein@warwick.ac.uk\n  institute: University of Warwick\n\nNote how each of the fields name, email, institute appear twice but in distinct maps.\nValues in maps can be lists too, as we said. The institute field is a case in point:\nauthor:\n- name: Susan Stebbing\n  institute: \n  - \"King's College London\"\n  - Bedford College, London\n- name: Someone Else\n  institute: Some University\n- name: Third Person\n  institute: Some College\n\nHere author is a list with three values, corresponding to the left-most dashes. Each is a map with two fields, name and institute. Note how the dashes in front of “King’s College” and “Bedford College” are aligned with the institute field name.\n\n\n8.6.4 List in lists\nThough we haven’t found a use for them in copyediting metadata, lists whose values are lists are also possible:\nmylistoflists:\n- - item1\n  - item2\n- - item3\n  - item4\n\nHere mylistoflists is a list with two values; the first value is itself a list with two values (item1, item2), and the second is another list with two values (item3, item4).",

Exceptions are cases where splitting wouldn’t make sense, e.g. “Pleasure: friend or foe?”.\nIf a title or subtitle contains colons or quotation marks, it should be either wrapped within quotation marks or entered as a text block. See Section 8.2.1.\nThe title and subtitle fields should not contain explicit linebreaks. (See Section 8.5 on what explicit linebreaks are.) Not only it’s best to let the reader’s device set the linebreaks in ‘fluid’ outputs (HTML, EPUB), but these fields are also used for the table of contents and to send information to a bibliographic database. They should thus be free of unnecessary formatting.\nSometimes, however, you need alternative forms of the title:\n\na short title to be used in page headers and/or the table of contents.\na title with explicit line breaks, when the title is long and default line breaks don’t look good in PDF output.\n\n\nFor these, your journal’s template should provide extra title fields. Dialectica, for instance, uses shorttitle if a shorter version is needed for page headers and the table of contents, title-latex if we need specific linebreaks on the article’s first page in PDF output, and title-cover if we need different linebreaks on the offprint cover than on the article’s first page.\nYour journal’s template may also have extra fields to handle how titles and subtitles appear in the table of contents. For instance, Dialectica shows both title and subtitle in the table of contents, separated by a colon. As the colon isn’t appropriate when the title ends with a question mark or other punctuation, the template provides a subtitleseparator field that can be used to replace the colon with a space.\nFor details see your journal template’s guidelines.",

    "section": "14.2 Paragraphs",
    "text": "14.2 Paragraphs\nNew paragraphs are encoded by leaving an empty line. That is, an empty line separates two paragraphs.\nIn typography paragraphs are distinguished from each other in two ways: first-line indentation (common in books) or a vertical space (common on the web). Your journal template will automatically typeset those.\nIf your journal template uses the first-line indent way of separating paragraphs, it will mostly handle typographic conventions correctly. For instance, it will be set not to indent the first line of paragraphs right below a heading (English convention) or to indent it (common in French). However, there are a few cases where you will need to manually specify that a first-line indent is or is not desired. See below.\nSometimes (rarely) you need a line break that does not start a new paragraph. See Section 12.8.\nProblem. Text that directly follows a list, quote, figure, table or other indented material (statement) may either be a continuation of the previous paragraph or the beginning of a new one. That is a matter of meaning (is the text finishing the previous idea, or beginning a new idea?) and may not be clear-cut in all cases. If your journal uses first-line indentation to separate paragraphs, continuations should not be typesetted with an indented first line, but new paragraphs should.\nThe engine makes default assumptions: normally text below a list, quotation or statement continues the paragraph above and text below a table is a new paragraph. When the default assumption is wrong, we need to manually specify that a paragraph’s indent is to be treated otherwise.\nThere are two ways to solve this.\n\nDialectica guidelines. Our template uses the first-line indentation style of separating paragraphs, and we use the first solution below. Sometimes it is unclear whether a paragraph continues the previous one or is a new one: the best is to ask the author, but you can also use your best judgment.\n\n\n14.2.1 With the first-line-indent filter\nRequires: the first-indent-line filter.\n\nAdd \\indent at the beginning of a paragraph to force a first-line indentation.\nAdd \\noindent at the beginning of a paragraph to prevent first-line indentation.\n\n\nExample. In the text below, the quotation ends the paragraph: the text below the quotation isn’t a continuation of the previous paragraph but a new paragraph. This goes against the default assumption, so we need to add \\indent. On the other hand, the paragraph under the table is a continuation of the previous one, which also goes against the default assumption. So we add a \\indent.\nIn the final words of the wise man:\n\n&gt; It's unclear what is going on here.\n\n\\indent Now on another note, we can see from the table below:\n\n\nTest group   Control group\n----------- ----------------\n.9            .9\n\n\\noindent That we don't observe any difference between the two groups.\n\nNote: \\indent and \\noindent are LaTeX code, but the first-line-indent filter ensures they are formatted correctly in other output formats.\nNote: you can follow this section’s advice even if your journal doesn’t currently use first-line indentation to separate paragraphs but vertical spaces instead. With the first-line-indent filter the added code won’t make a difference to the output, but it will allow you to switch to first-line indent later if needed.\nSee the first-line-indent filter’s page for more options and information.\n\n\n14.2.2 Without the filter\nIf your journal does not use the first-line-indent filter, you can only control first-line indentation for the LaTeX/PDF output, not HTML.\nWithout the filter, text after any block element is treated as a new paragraph.\n\nAdd \\noident at the beginning of paragraphs following quotations, statements, lists unless they are genuinely new paragraphs.\n\n\nYou may add \\indent on paragraphs that need to be indented, but that’ll be the default.\nNote: if your journal currently uses vertical spacing rather than first-line indentation to separate paragraphs, adding \\noindent codes does no harm. But if you don’t use the first-line-indent filter, adding \\indent codes will indent paragraphs even if the journal style uses vertical spacing. So either use the filter or don’t use indent codes unless your journal is set to use first-line indentation.",

    "text": "14.4 Footnotes and endnotes\nYou can encode notes. Markdown doesn’t distinguish footnotes and endnotes: there’s only one kind of note, and your journal template decides where they’re printed out.\nThere are two ways to enter notes called inline and by reference link. In the inline method, the note is weaved within the text itself, as follows:\nThis is the main text.^[In the footnote, I distract you with an irrelevant point.]\n  This continues the main text.\n\nIn the reference link method, we only put a reference to the note in the text, and the note text is given separately—typically below the paragraph in question or at the end of the manuscript:\nThis is the main text.[^fn1] This continues the main text.\n\n[^fn1]: In the footnote, I distract you with an irrelevant point.\n\nBoth methods produce the very same output:\n\n\nThis is the main text.1 This continues the main text.\n\n\nThe inline method is best suited for short notes. The reference-link method is better suited for longer notes and is required when a footnote spans multiple paragraphs.\nWarning for international keyboard users. If you’re using the International US Keyboard (and perhaps other), entering ^[ will probably result in a small circumflex accent instead of a big one: compare ˆ and ^. To get the big one, press Shift+6 (the key for ^) then the space key.\n\n14.4.1 Inline method\nIn the inline method, you place ^[...] where you want the note number to appear, and you place the text of the footnote between the brackets. Note that the ^ character is outside the brackets.\nThis is the main text.^[In the footnote, I distract you with an irrelevant point.]\n  This continues the main text.\n\nThe note text may contain markdown codes, except blocks. It’ll be a single block (paragraph) in the output.\n\n\n14.4.2 Reference link method\nIn the reference link method, you place [^id] where you want the note number to appear. Note that the ^ character is inside the bracket. id is an arbitrary identifier: it can be a number like 2, or something like fn1 or footnote_about_dogs. It can’t contain spaces, linebreaks, tabs or the characters ^, [, ].\nThe identifier must be unique to that footnote in your markdown file. It does not affect which number the footnote has in the output, even if it’s a number. Thus if you enter the article’s first footnote as:\nThis is the main text.[^15] This continues the main text.\n\nIt will still be numbered 1.\nThe footnote text is then placed elsewhere in the document, in a paragraph starting with [^id]. Where you place it doesn’t affect the output: it’ll be printed out as a footnote if your journal footnotes, as an endnote if it uses endnotes.\nThis is the main text.[^fn1] This continues the main text.\n\n[ˆfn1]: In the footnote, I distract you with an irrelevant point.\n\nThe note can contain any markdown codes, including blocks other than notes.\n\n\n14.4.3 Multi-paragraph notes\nUsing the reference-link method, you can enter long notes consisting of multiple paragraphs. You simply need to indent the paragraphs:\nThis is the paragraph where the note appears.[^fn2] The paragraph\ncontinues for a bit and then ends.\n\n[^fn2]: This is the footnote text. I've placed it below the paragraph\n    where the footnote appears, though I could have placed it at\n    the very end of the document, or anywhere else for that matter.\n\n    This is still part of the footnote---it's a second paragraph of\n    the footnote. Note how it's indented two spaces like the first\n    paragraph. If it wasn't, it would be considered part of the\n    main text.\n\nThis is the following paragraph of the main text. It's not indented,\nso it's not part of the footnote.\n\nResult:\n\n\nThis is the paragraph where the note appears.2 The paragraph continues for a bit and then ends.\nThis is the following paragraph of the main text. It’s not indented, therefore it’s not part of the footnote.\n\n\nFour spaces indentation on each paragraph should work.3 If you encounter trouble, see “Troubleshooting” at the end of this section.\nNotes can contain other kind of blocks other than notes themselves: quotations, images, Divs (see below), etc.\nThis is the main text.[^3] This continues the main text.\n\n[^3]: This note takes more space.\n\n    It contains several paragraphs.\n                 \n    &gt; It even includes a quotation.\n                 \n    And it ends here.\n\nResult:\n\n\nThis is the main text.4 This continues the main text.\n\n\nTroubleshooting. Too much or not enough indentation on the paragraphs may ‘break’ the note; in output, the broken text appears where you’ve placed the footnote text—below the original paragraph or at the end of the document. If it appears as normal text, check the paragraphs are aligned first, and if they are, try more indentation. If it appears as code text (monospace font), you have too much indentation (more than 4 spaces), reduce it.\n\n\n14.4.4 Note numbers: placement, multiple\nNote numbers appear at the end of a sentence or a clause—not after specific words. In English typesetting, note numbers are placed after any punctuation other than dashes.\n\n\nmentioned before.1 GOOD\n\n\n\nmentioned before1. BAD\n\n\n\nmentioned before1—though only once. GOOD\n\n\nIf placing multiple note numbers consecutively, separate them with a superscripted comma. For the comma to be interpreted correctly you may need an invisible ‘zero-width non-joiner space’:\nmentioned before[^fn1]^,^&zwnj;[^fn2].\n\n\nmentioned before1,2.\n\n\n\n14.4.5 Fusing multiple markdown documents\nUnless your journal template’s guidelines specify otherwise, it’s fine to use the same identifier, e.g. 1, in different articles.\n\n\n14.4.6 Cross-referencing footnotes\nCross-reference to footnotes has to be done manually. Don’t enter them before you know that the footnote numbers in the output are final. See Section 23.3.",

    "text": "14.5 Divs\nDivs are general-purpose blocks that we use to typeset advanced elements like statements or to mark out sections of a document for special treatment, e.g. ‘imagifying’ all the LaTeX formulas it contains. This section explains how to encode them.\nA Div is an arbitrary document division, usually invisible to the reader. It contains one or more blocks—which can be paragraphs, quotations, etc. or even other Divs. It also has attributes, and that is what makes it useful: for we use the attributes to tell our typesetting engine that the Div’s content is to receive special treatment. In the case of statements, we use a Div with the special statement attribute to tell the engine that its contents are a statement—hence, that they must be indented.\nIn markdown, Divs are created using a pair of “fences”, which are single lines consisting of one or more colons:\n\nThis paragraph is in the document's main flow.\n\n:::\n\nThis paragraph is inside a Div.\n\nThis paragraph is also inside the same Div\n\n:::\n\nThe first ::: fence opens the Div, the second one closes it. We can include a Div within a Div by using a greater number of colons for the enclosed one:\n\nThis paragraph is in the document's main flow.\n\n:::\n\nThis paragraph is inside a Div.\n\n:::::\n\nThis paragraph is inside a new Div that's inside the first Div.\n\n:::::\n\nThis paragraph is inside the first Div.\n\n:::\n\nIt’s good practice, though not technically necessary, to use the same number of colons for the opening fence and the closing fence of the same Div.\nThe Divs in the examples above are completely invisible in PDF or HTML outputs. Divs become interesting when you give them attributes. Attributes are added to the opening fence of a Div, between curly braces, separated by spaces:\n\n::: {.statement #myprinciple color=red}\n\nEverything comes in due time.\n\n:::\n\nThis illustrates the three kinds of attributes a Div may have:\n\none or more classes indicated with a dot, e.g. .statement. A class indicates that the Div is of a certain kind. Several Div can be of the same class (kind), and a single Div can have several kinds.\nan unique identifier aka ID: indicated with a hash, e.g. #myprinciple. This uniquely identifies a Div, to cross-reference it for instance. A Div can only have one ID, and a Div’s ID should not be assigned to any other Div nor even to any other element (such as a heading, figure, etc.).\nKey-value pairs, indicated by the equal sign, e.g. color=red. These are used to state that a certain aspect of the Div (e.g., the text color) has a certain value. If the value contains space or special symbols it’s enclosed in quotation marks.\n\n\nFor statements only classes and IDs are relevant.\nWhen a Div’s attributes consist of a single class, and nothing else, it can be encoded without curly braces and dots. Thus the following:\n\n::: {.statement}\n\nEverything comes in due time.\n\n:::\n\ncan be abbreviated:\n\n::: statement\n\nEverything comes in due time.\n\n:::\n\nSome prefer more visible fences. You can use full lines of colons. If there are attributes, you may add colons after the attributes too. For instance, the earlier attributes example can just as well be encoded as:\n\n::: { .statement #myprinciple color=red } :::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nEverything comes in due time.\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThat is wholly up to you: using full-width fences or shorter ones makes no difference to the result.",

Closing quotation mark before punctuation marks unless these are parts of the quote:\n\nShe never said the word ‘traitor’&zmj;.\n\n\n\nPandoc applies the US convention by default. This can be avoided globally by setting the document’s language to en-GB. It can be avoided on a case-by-case basis by using a “zero-width joiner” characters, markdown code &zmj;:\nShe never said the word 'traitor'&zmj;.\n\n\nShe never said the word ‘traitor’&zmj;.\n\n\nDialectica guidelines\nDialectica prefers the US/Chicago convention for quoted material, that is double quote. Exception: you can use single quotes for special uses other than quoting material (see ‘mention’ below).\n\n\n15.2.1 Quoting words (mention)\nWhen a word or expression is used not with its usual meaning but to denote that word or expression itself, we use quotation marks or italics.\n\n\nI can’t stand the word ‘scrumptious’.\n\n\n\nI can’t stand the word scrumptious.\n\n\nDon’t use italics if the word is scare-quoted, put a distance, quoted from some other person’s use, etc. Italics are only appropriate if we’re talking of the word or expression italicized.\n\nDialectica guidelines. If references to a word or words are common throughout the paper, as in e.g. linguistics papers, italics are recommended. It’s often best to distinguish mention from quoted material:\n\nuse italics or single quotation marks for mentions. Example:\n\nThe predicate ‘gave \\(x\\) to \\(y\\)’ has three argument places.\n\nif using single quotation marks, do not bring punctuation marks inside.\n\nThe verbs ‘know’, ‘believe’ are cognitive verbs.

You don’t control punctuation, i.e whether the number is followed by a point, single parenthesis or double parenthesis—that is up to your template.\n\n\nIf you need finer control of bullets or numbers, consider custom-labelled lists.\n\n\n16.1.0.3 First-line indentation after lists\nRequires: first-line indent filter.\nIf you use first-line indents rather than vertical space to separate paragraph, you may want to control whether the paragraph below a list is indented or not. There is no mechanical rule for this: it depends on whether the material following the list should be considered as one paragraph with the material before and the list, or whether we should instead consider that the list ends a paragraph.\nIn most cases, the list does not end a paragraph and the material below forms a unity with the material before. The paragraph below should then not be indented. That is the default setting of the first-line indent filter, so you do not need to do anything.\nIf the list does end a paragraph, you can ensure the next paragraph starts with an indentation by adding \\indent at its beginning.\n\n\n16.1.1 What to do if a list has non-standard labels?\nProblem: a text has a list with regularly numbered items (1, 2, 3, or a, b, c, …) but uses * or ' labels in some cases.\nThere are two solutions to this:\n\nIf it’s not too important to single out some items with * or ', then you can re-number the author’s list, using a simple numbered list instead.\nIf it is important to preserve the author’s labels, e.g. if it helps comprehension to see item ’2**’ as a revision of item ‘2’, then use custom labelled lists.",

The default syntax is [inline text]{attributes}. Inline text will be used as label, placed within round bracket.\nThere is no need to specify attributes on the Span. But curly brackets must be present: [label] won’t work, [label]{} will.\nThe label can include formatting. [**T1**]{} will generate a label with strong emphasis (bold by default).\nSpan elements can also be entered using HTML syntax: &lt;span&gt;inline     text   &lt;/span&gt;. See [Pandoc manual] (https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) for details.\n\n\nIf an article has many custom labelled lists with empty labels (see Arguments), you may set the delimiters to be empty rather than parentheses by default. See the labelled-lists.lua filter manual.\n\n16.3.1 Commonly used custom labels\nSee also the section on symbols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want\nI type\n\n\n\n\nA*, A**, …\nA*, A**, …\n\n\nA′, A″, A‴, A⁗\nA&prime;, A&Prime;, A&tprime;, A&qprime;\n\n\nA1, A2, …\nA^1^, A^2^, …\n\n\nA1, A2, …\nA~1~, A~2~, …\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3.2 Cross-referencing custom-label items\nCustom labels can be given internal identifiers. The syntax is [label]{#identifier}. In the list below, A1ref, A2ref and Cref identify the item:\n* [**A1**]{#A1ref} This is the first claim.\n* [A2]{#A2ref} This is the second claim.\n* [*C*]{#Cref} This is the conclusion.\n\nNote that # is not part of the identifier. Identifiers should start with a letter and contain only letters, digits, colons :, dots ., dashes - and underscores _.\nLabels with identifiers can be crossreferenced using Pandoc’s citations or internal links.\n\n\n16.3.3 Cross-referencing with citations\nThe basic syntax is:\n\nReference in text: @A1ref. Outputs the label with its formatting: A1.\nNormal reference: [@A1ref]. Outputs the label with its formatting, in parentheses: (A1). A prefix and suffix can be specified too: [remember @A1ref and the like] will output (remember A1 and the like).\nThe suppressed author style, [-@A1ref], will be processed as normal reference\n\n\nYou can crossrefer to several custom labels at a time: [@A1ref; @A2ref]. But mixing references to a custom label with bibliographic ones in a same citation won’t work: if Smith2003 is a key in your bibliography [@A1ref; Smith2003] will only output “((A1ref?); Smith, 2003)”.\nBecause this syntax overlaps with Pandoc’s citation syntax, conflicts should be avoided:\n\nAvoid giving the same identifier (e.g. Smith2005) to a custom label item and a bibliographic entry. If that happens, the citation will be interpreted as crossreference to the custom label item. To make sure you you may use identifiers starting with item:: item:A1ref, item:A2ref, or some other prefix.\nThe filter should preferably be run before citeproc, and before other filters that use citations (like pandoc-crossref). It may work properly even if it is run after, though citeproc will issue “citations not found” warnings. To ensure that the filter is run before, just place it before in the command line or in your YAML options file’s filters field.\n\n\nAlternatively, the citation syntax for crossreferencing custom label items can be deactivated. See [Customization] below.\n\n\n16.3.4 Cross-referencing with internal links\nIn Pandoc markdown internal links are created with the syntax [link  text](#target_identifier). (Note the rounded brackets instead of curly ones for Span element identifiers.) You can use internal links to cross-refer to custom label items that have a identifier. If your link has no text, the label with its formatting will be printed out; otherwise whichever text you give for the link. For instance, given the custom labelled list above, the following:\nThe claim [](#A1ref) together with [the next claim](#A2ref) \nentail ([](#Cref)).\n\nwill output:\n\n\nThe claim A1 together with the next claim entail (C).\n\n\nwhere the links point to the corresponding items in the list.\n\n\n16.3.5 Custom labelled lists within a numbered example list\nRequires: labelled-lists.lua, statement.lua.\nIn some cases we wanted to put a custom labelled list within a numbered example list. This is particularly difficult when we don’t want any content in the numbered example item other than the embedded list itself.\nSolution: place the embedded list within a statement. Note that the embedded content must be indented exactly twice (4 spaces). This works:\n(@example-Batu) \n\n    ::: statement\n\n    * []{delimiter=none} Every head of a horse is a head \n     of an animal.\n    * [&there4;]{} Batu is a head of an animal.\n  \n    ::::\n\nYou should reduce the right margin for the LaTeX output. (LaTeX experts: the statement is placed in a minipage whose with is that of the text minus the default list label width; this is typically too large for an embedded list.)\n(@Allskunksaremammals) \n\n    ::: statement\n\n    * []{} All skunks are mammals. `\\addtolength{\\rightskip}{1em} % fix needed`{=latex}\n\n    * [&there4;]{} All who fear all who respect all skunks fear all who respect all mammals.\n    :::",

    "text": "17.1 Basic table syntax\nThere are three formats to encode tables in pandoc’s markdown (‘simple’, ‘grid’ and ‘pipe’). Some are easier to type, some easier to read, some give more functionality (i.e. having several lines in a cell).\nThe easiest way to create a table is to use RStudio’s visual editor. The editor allows you to create multiline cells, resize the columns a bit and so on. Alternatively, you can write tables in the markdown code. An online markdown table generator can help.\nFor tables with large cells (a lot of text in the cell), you might need to expand the “wrap line size” for the RStudio editor. The visual editor ensures that your markdown files has lines of a certain length. These don’t matter to the final PDF / html output, but they make your markdown source more readable. Now when you have a large table, you might need a bit more horizontal space in the markdown. For that you increase the wrap line size for the editor. In your file metadata block:\nReplace 72 with e.g. 80 or more if needed.

The instructions using Divs with not-in-format class below require the not-in-format filter.\nIn case the usual markdown code for a table doesn’t work, we can insert a set of LaTeX code to the markdown file. The goal is then to have a set of latex code that can be inserted into the articles markdown file and then be run the usual way. For that, there are three steps needed:\n\nget the latex code for the desired table\nmake the table look as desired\nget the code into the markdown file.\n\n\nGenerate a separate markdown file (in the following called “separate .md”, whereas the initial markdown file of the article is called “articles .md”). Here we want to put only the latex code that will be inserted into the articles .md.\n\nFor the first step (get the latex code for the desired table), there are two options:\n\n\nBuild the latex code from scratch or via the table generator for latex, put the code to the separate .md.\nBuild the markdown code from scratch or via the table generator for markdown, put it to the separate .md, let it produce a latex output, copy/paste the latex code to the separate .md (it probably begins with something like \\begin{longtable} or \\begin{table} and ends with something like \\end{longtable} or \\end{table}).\n\n\nOnce you have the latex code in the separate .md, you can embed it in the following code:\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{center}\n\n[latex code for tables]\n\n\\end{center}\n```\n\nThe \\begin{center} and \\end{center} lines are optional, their effet is to center your table in the page.\nThe LaTeX code will only produce a result in LaTeX/PDF output. If the markdown code works with HTML output, you should leave it and embed it in a ::: {.not-in-format .latex} ... ::: Div, which ensures that the markdown table code is used only in formats other than LaTeX.\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{center}\n\n[latex code for your table]\n\n\\end{center}\n```\n\n::: {.not-in-format .latex}\n\n[markdown code for your table]\n\n:::\n\nCheck how the tables look by producing pdfs from the separate .md (much faster than always producing the whole article).\n\nFrom here, you might have or want to change several things:\n\n\n“longtable” -&gt; “tabular” (so that it doesn’t rely on longtable package, which doesn’t work within multicolumn environments).\n\\toprule, \\midrule and \\bottomrule -&gt; \\hline for simple horizontal lines\nIf a vertical line is desired at some point in the table change latex code \\begin{tabular}[]{@{}lcccc@{}} to \\begin{tabular}[]{@{}c|cccc@{}}. See that the number of letters determines the number of columns in the table. The letter “l” in the former code is to change into a “c” in the latter. To have a vertical line after the first column from the left, insert the sign (not letter!) “|” after the first c from the left.\n\n\nOnce that frame is set, we can insert the code from the separate .md into the articles .md and see how it produces the tables from here.\n\n\nYou may need to do the same to insert HTML code. In that case you should still leave the original markdown for other formats (JATS-XML), using not-in-format again:\n  ```{=latex}\n  [latex code for your table]\n  ```\n  ```{=html}\n  [html code for your table]\n  ```\n  ::: {.not-in-format .latex .html}\n  [markdown code for your table]\n  :::",

It should be present in the folder. If it is in another folder give a path: path/to/file.jpg.\nalt text is the alt text. Originally, it is text that is meant replace the image for visually impaired readers and when the image file is missing, on webpages. But it becomes the image’s caption if it is treated as a floated figure.\ntitle, called the title, is optional text that is typically displayed when hovering above the image on webpages. It is not displayed at all in PDF output.\n\n\nInline or Floated. An image command is:\n\nA floated figure if it is on a single line, separated by blank lines, and with a non-empty alt text,\nAn inline figure otherwise.\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Inline figure from a file\nIf you do not separate the image common from the surrounding text by blank lines, the image will be mixed with the text itself:\nThe image below:\n![](file.jpg \"a nice cat picture\")\nwill be printed in the middle of a line of text.\n\nIn most cases, you want to separate it. You should then make sure you leave the alt text empty, otherwise the image will be treated as a floated figure:\nThe image below:\n\n![](file.jpg \"a nice cat picture\")\n\nis separated from the text above and below.\n\nNote that you cannot cross-reference inline figures.\n\n\n18.2.3 Floated figure from a file\nInsert an image command on a line of its own, surrounded by blank lines:\n![Caption of the figure.](file.svg 'optional hovering text')\n\nYou can add attribute to specify a width or height and a id for cross-reference:\nPrevious text... See @fig:figure1.\n\n![Caption of the figure.](file.svg){#fig:figure1 width=50%}\n\n\n18.2.4 Figure size\nWidth and heigh attributes can be specified:\nInline figure: ![](figure1.jpg){width=25%}.\n\n![Caption of a floating figure.](figure1.tikz){#fig:myfigure width=33%}\n\nManuscript text resumes here.\n\nSince we are targeting outputs of different sizes and units (PDFs in pt, HTML in pixel) it is safer to use a relative unit like percentage.

    "text": "18.4 Background on vector vs bitmap formats\n(Skip this section if you are familiar with the distinction).\nWhat’s the difference between vector and bitmap image files? Bitmap (a.k.a. raster) images are encoded as a grid of pixels. Vector images are encoded as mathematical descriptions of lines and curves. For instance, a vector image may be (the computer-language equivalent of) “draw a circle of radius 10mm around the coordi nate (0,0).” The bitmap equivalent would be a big grid with cells coloured to form a circle. Because of this, vector images scale perfectly and magnify perfectly. Bitmap images can get noisy and pixelated when scaled or magnified. See below if you can tell which is which:\n \nAs you can see, the vector (first one) looks smooth when magnified, the bitmap looks pixelated.\nWhy use vector images for diagrams? They’re much better quality and use much less space. A bitmap diagram easily looks pixelated in print or on a high-resolution screen; it’ll look unprofessional to the reader. Bitmaps in high resolution can look good even in print or when enlarged on a screen, but at the cost of using a lot of space: a 1920*1080 high resolution bitmap easily takes about 1000 times the space of vector version of the same diagram; an article with bitmap images can easily occupy the same space as 10 to 100 articles without. It’s only in the case of highly textured images (e.g. photos) that a vector version would be either impossible or much heavier than a bitmap.\nWhich file types are vector, which are bitmap?\n\nJPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF: bitmap images.\nPDF: can be bitmap, vector, and even images combining the two. The only way to tell is to zoom in a lot and see whether the lines remain perfect (vector) or pixelate (bitmap). File size is also an indicator: vectors are hardly more than a few Kbs, bitmaps can be anything from a few Kbs to one Mb or so.\nSVG: vector. Exception: an SVG file can import bitmaps from other files, including by URL. So in principle an author could send you a SVG ‘conversion’ that is nothing else than a link to an online version of their image. You’re very unlikely to encounter that problem, but if in doubt: the SVG file is a text file, you can open it in a text editor. Look for the tag &lt;image , e.g. &lt;image href=\"mybitmap.pgn\" width=\"200px\"/&gt;.\n\n\nHow to convert a bitmap image to a vector image? It can’t really be done. The problem is that the computer has to guess from the pixel grid of a bitmap image what’s supposed to be a line, a curve, etc. and that requires some intelligence (think of it like this: we’re going from a limited resolution to infinite precision). This is called vectorizing the bitmap image. Software like Inkscape can try and vectorize images for you, but you have to fiddle with the settings for each specific image, and the results are rarely satisfactory. In most cases, your or the author will have a much easier time recreating the image in vector mode. If you want to try to vectorize anyway, search “vectorize an image in Inkscape” or “convert an image to SVG” online to find some tutorials.",

    "text": "18.5 How to create or convert images\n\n18.5.1 Prefer vector formats for figures\nDiagrams, figures and the like should be provided in vector graphics formats (SVG files or code or TikZ code in LaTeX). Only photos, hand-drawn illustrations and the like should be provided as bitmap (a.k.a. raster) files. If you’re not familiar with the difference, see the explanation below.\nIf an author provides a diagram in bitmap form we ask that they recreated it in a vector format. Inkscape is an open-source, free software to generate vector images that is fairly easy to use and powerful. Authors who write in LaTeX may try to create in using the TikZ package instead.\nNote on PowerPoint. Some authors provide figures in MS Power Point. To convert to SVG, you will typically need to open it in MS Power Point (rather than Libreoffice) and convert to SVG there.\n\n\n18.5.2 How to create a vector image?\nHow to create a vector image? Draw it in an editor, or code it in TikZ.\n\nDrawing in a vector graphics editor. Wikipedia has a [list of visual graphics editor]. Fully-featured editors will cover all needs but may require more work. Inkscape is the best open-source one; Adobe Illustrator a good propertary one. However for simple diagrams you may be able to get by with a quick-and-dirty online editor. There are quite a few of those; try online svg editor in a search engine (check whether you need to pay to save your file). At the moment\nDrawSVG seems good (easy to use, free and no registration, ads).\n\n\nTikZ diagrams. TikZ is a language to describe vector images that can be embedded in LaTeX. It’s powerful but has a very steep learning curve. If authors can provide them, TikZ diagrams are the best - because any text in those diagrams will be printed out in the journal’s own fonts. TikZ code can be included directly in the markdown. Our template will include them directly in the LaTeX/PDF output and convert them to SVG files for other output formats.\nHow to create a TikZ diagram? Typically the author needs to go through the (large) TikZ documentation and work from existing examples. But there is also an online visual editor (TikZit) that can help.\n\n\n18.5.3 How to modify a bitmap image\nWikipedia has a list of bitmap image editors. GIMP is the best open-source editor. Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements is a good commercial one, photography-oriented.\n\n\n18.5.4 Figures with letters or text\nFigures often include letters or text. They look best if their fonts are consistent throughout your journal. It is desirable, but not mandatory, your house template fonts. If these can be freely distributed you could ask authors to install them and use them, but that’s a tall order. It’ll typically fall on you to apply house fonts if possible.\n\nFigures in TikZ code: automatic. TikZ specifies the text, not the fonts, so your house template will render the figures with your house fonts.\nFigures in SVG. Use a good editor like Inkscape with the house fonts installed on your computer. Open the file, select text elements, change their font. It should be quick. Exception: in some rare cases, the original files may have encoded the characters as complicated lines rather than characters proper; if so the editor won’t recognize them as text and change their font. If so your only option would be to remove the original text and recreate it: it is probably more time-costly than it’s worth.\nFigures in bitmap format: can’t realistically be done. Editing in a bitmap editor is possible but probably more time-costly than it’s worth.

    "text": "18.6 Troubleshooting\n\n18.6.1 [WARNING] Could not convert image…\nIf you insert an SVG image file in markdown and generate a PDF output, Pandoc needs to convert it to a format that LaTeX understands. It does so using an external programme, rsvg-convert. If rsvg-convert is not present, you will get a warning: [WARNING] Could not convert image...: check that rsvg-convert is in path.\nSolutions\n\nConvert the SVG files to PDF using Inkscape. They will still be vector file and print out well, but the LaTeX engine that generates your PDF output will be able to insert them. Open the file(s) in Inkscape, go to File &gt; Save a copy, select the “Portable Document Format (pdf)” format, save. In your markdown code replace ImageFile.svg with ImageFile.pdf.\nInstall rsvg-convert. As far as we can tell the least difficult way to do this is to use package managers. On Linux look for rsvg-convert in your package manager. On MacOS you should install homebrew first, if you haven’t already, and run the command brew install rsvg-convert. On Win you should install the chocolatey package manager, open an administrator Powershell (Windows menu &gt; Windows Powersheel &gt; right click on Powershell and select “Run as Administrator”, give the permission) and run the command choco install rsvg-convert.\n\n\nNote: on Windows Pandoc 2.14.0.3 (June 2021 version) cannot handle SVG conversion, even if rsvg-convert is installed. If that’s your setup use the first solution.",

For the latter see Chapter 26.\nArguments that are set out of the main text can be typeset as statements. But when they have labelled premises, especially when we need to crossrefer to specific premises or the conclusion, we typeset them as custom-labelled lists. See Section 16.4.\nThe simplest statements are just a block of idented text. Optionally, some statements have a label (aka title). They may also have some extra encoded fields like acronym, info, ID for crossreferencing—these are explained below.\nStatements are encoded as Divs. See Section 14.5 if you don’t yet know what Divs are.\nA statement is encoded as a Div with the special class statement:\nAs detailed in Section 14.5, there are a couple of equivalent variations for this code. Provided that the Div has no other attribute that the statement class, curly braces can be omitted:\nThe opening and closing ‘fences’ can also be made as wide as you want if that improves readability.

It is often possible to provide it alongside markdown. Caution: use sparingly. Don’t tinker with e.g. line or list spacing on a per-article basis.\nExample: you have a markdown table that you’re happy with, but it’s too wide to fit in a PDF page. You can make its text smaller in PDF output with:\n`{\\small`{=latex}\n\n+-----+-------+\n|know |valua- |\n|ledge|tion   |\n+=====+=======+\n|...  |...    |\n+-----+-------+\n\n`}`{=latex}\n\nUsing `...`{=latex} creates an (inline) element of raw code that is passed as is to latex and erased in other formats. {\\small .... } in LaTeX creates a group ({...}) within which the text is small.\n\n\n21.1.2 Providing a Raw LaTeX alternative\nRequirement. The not-in-format filter is required for some of the below.\nWhen there is no markdown solution to typeset something there is fallback solution: include raw output code of other formats directly in your markdown document. We first figure out how the element should be coded in relevant output formats (LaTeX, html, xml); we call this raw code. Then we insert raw code without our markdown document.\nIn some cases you’re happy with the output markdown generates in some, but not all, formats. For instance, the XML output is fine (XML has no typesetting), but you’d like to do some fine-grained typesetting in LaTeX that the normal LaTeX output doesn’t handle. In that case you’ll use markdown for some output formats, but provide raw code only for LaTeX.\nTo provide Raw code for all output formats, you insert it as follows:\n``` {=latex}\n... LaTeX code here ...\n```\n``` {=html}\n... html/epub code here ...\n```\n``` {=xml}\n... xml code here ...\n```\n\nThe part marked with {=latex} will be included as is in the LaTeX output (for PDFs) and only in the LaTeX output.\nTo provide raw code for some, but not all, formats, you should put the relevant bits of markdown within a not-in-format div, and the raw code after it. (This method requires the not-in-format Pandoc filter.) For instance:\n::: {.not-in-format .latex}\n-------- -------\nsimple    table\n-------- -------\n:::\n\n```{=latex}\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{ll}\n\\hline\nsimple & table\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n```\n\nHere the simple markdown table enclosed within :::{.not-in-format .latex} … ::: will be used for all outputs formats except LaTeX and LaTeX-based outputs like PDF and beamer. The raw code below included within ```{=latex} … ``` will be used for LaTeX and LaTeX-based outputs.\nYou can leave out some markdown section from several formats too: :::{.not-in-format .xml .latex}.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "23.1 Cross-referencing sections\nWhen an article cross-references its sections, figures, tables, images, numbered examples, equations and footnotes, we encode these in markdown. This ensures that they are linked (and, in some cases, standardly labeled and properly numbered) in the outputs.\nCross-references to sections, figures, tables, and images are handled by the pandoc-crossref extension of pandoc. We describe its basic usage described below (full documentation here).\nCross-references to numbered examples are handled by Pandoc itself, usage described below.\nAt the moment we cannot handle neatly cross-references to footnotes. A workaround is given below.\nTo cross-reference a section you first need to know its identifier. Pandoc accepts manually specified identifiers but also automatically generates identifiers. A manually specified identifier is given by adding {#sec:mysecid} after the heading. An automatically generated identifier is obtained by putting the section heading in lowercase, removing all formatting, links, or footnotes, removing all characters other than letters, numbers, underscore, periods and hyphens, and replacing spaces with hyphens. Some examples:\nSpecial cases. If a heading starts with something else than a letter, everything before that letter is removed (to ensure that all identifiers start with a letter). If a heading is empty, its identifier is section. If there are several headings of the same name (say, section), the second one is suffixed with -1 (section-1) then -2, etc.\nWarning: of course, if you change a section heading title, the automatically generated identifier changes. So if your headings might change, either use manual identifiers or wait before entering cross-references.\nWhen editing in RStudio visual mode, you can use Insert &gt; Cross-reference to find heading identifiers. A menu with the list of headings is displayed; pick the one you want and the editor will insert the code @ref(the-first-word). Remove @ref(…), and enter @sec: right in front of the the-first-word. The code @sec:the-first-word should become blue as you type @ and the following letters; if not it’s not interpreted as a reference, try again or edit in code mode instead.\nNow to cross-reference sections with identifiers the-first-word, the-second-word, use the following code:\nNote that @Sec:… instead of @sec:… capitalizes the label. Note that the quare-bracketed version doesn’t add parentheses (unlike in citations): the square brackets are only necessary if you have several references or a manually specified prefix (below).\nThe prefix (“sec.” here) is specified by the template. It can be suppressed or manually specified:\nAs the last line illustrates, you need to repeat the custom prefix for each entries that it applies to, even though in the output they will be grouped.\nStyle recommendations.\nCall subsections “sections” when referencing to them. If you’re referencing a subsection, you should still call it “section” in the readable text: ``cf. section [@sec:asubsectionid]. A subsection is a section, and the terminology of “subsection” is clunky and technical.\nAvoid specifying a manual prefix just to follow the author’s style.

The code is see @Doe2012 [@Smith2016] as explained above.\nInline citations of multiple references by the same author, on the other hand, should look like this: “See Doe (2012; 2016)”, as explained above. The code is see @Doe2012 [@Doe2016].\nIf you get “see Doe (2012; Doe 2016)”:\n\nif Doe is author of one reference but editor of the other, this is normal. Leave it like that.\nif Doe is the author of both (or the editor of both), this is an error in your bibliography file: Doe’s name isn’t recognized as the same, probably because it’s entered differently on both references. Typically, this is because the first name is different (“Doe, J” vs “Doe, Jane”) or because of a extra initial (“Doe, Jane” vs “Doe, Jane E.”).\n\n\n\n24.1.2 Locators: ibid., Op. Cit., sec. or § and the like\nThe template decides what the locators are. Whether repeated citations are printed out as “ibid”, “op. cit”, whether page ranges are referred to as “pp. 12-15” or “p. 12-15” or “12-15”, whether sections are called “sec.” or “§”, etc., all of this is decided and automatically handled by the bibliography template.\nIf an author uses ibid. or op. cit., just replace it with the original citation. For instance, if the author’s manuscript has:\n\n\nLewis (1986, 19) says something important. He adds something less interesting a few pages later (ibid., 29).\n\n\nWe encode:\n@Lewis1986 [19] says something important. He adds something less\ninteresting a few pages later [@Lewis1986, 29].\n\nExceptions: how to override defaults. Exceptionally you may need to override the default locators. For instance, the section locator ‘sec.’ might look odd when citing historical works traditionally referred to using ‘§’. In those exceptional cases, ensure that your locators are printed as is by preceeding them with an invisible ‘zero-width non-joiner’ charater (`‌’):\n\nSee @frege:1967a [&zwnj;§11]. Many agree [@smith, &zwnj;pp. 56-58].\n\n\n24.1.3 Citing Notes, Footnotes, and Endnotes\nWe don’t distinguish between foot- and endnotes and only use note.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want\nI type\n\n\n\n\n(Smith, 2012, n. 11)\n[@Smith2012, n.11] or [@Smith2012, note 11]\n\n\n\nFor how to cross-reference footnotes from the same article see Section 23.3.\n\n\n24.1.4 Conflicts of Cites with Other Commands\nIn some cases, cites are not rendered correctly in the output if they appear right next to another command (e.g., \\noindent, \\indent, or [^1]). In order to solve this proplem, we can use the HTML-command &zwnj; (‘zero-width-non-joiner’).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want\nI type\n\n\n\n\n(Smith, 2012, 11)1\n[@Smith2012, 11]&zwnj;[^1]\n\n\n(Smith, 2012, 11)\n\\noindent&zwnj;[@Smith2012, 11]\n\n\n  (Smith, 2012, 11)\n\\indent&zwnj;[@Smith2012, 11]\n\n\n\n\n\n24.1.5 Putting a citation link on a page number, or a word\nCitations must all be in one of the three forms above (Normal, Inline or Year-only). We cannot, and should not, put them on arbitrary words or page numbers. For instance, in the following:\n@Lewis1986 [19] says something important, but see also page 29.\n\nWe could either turn “page 29” in an inline or year-only citation, or leave it without link—provided there’s already a link to the work nearby, as is the case above.",

More generally, avoid parentheses when the references is in parentheses:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018).\n\n\nBut also, if we’re citing Jane Doe’s introduction to Smith (2018), we should have a bibliography entry for that chapter itself. So ultimately we want:\n\n\n(e.g., Jones, 2017, Doe 2018).\n\n\nProposed\nFirst attempt, use two inline citations. But it results in a double parenthesis:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones (2019), and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith (2018)).\n\nas much (e.g., @jones_j:2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018).\n\nSecond attempt, make it a single parenthesis citation with two references, on the model (Jones 2019; Smith 2018) ([@jones_j:2017; @smith_j:2018]). But pandoc doesn’t see it as a citation and the phrase disappears:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much Smith (2018).\n\nas much [e.g., @jones_j:2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018].\n\nWhat is going on? The syntax of inline citation separates prefixes and suffixes with commas (,) or spaces and different references with semi-colons (;). So the general rule is: if you have two keys you should have a semi-colon. In the code above what pandoc sees is:\n[prefix, @citekey, verylongsuffix]\n\nwhere verylongsuffix is the code and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018. But a suffix cannot include citations. It can only be simple text (and passim or a famous passage) or locator type + location (chap. 2, pages 12-13) or location (12-13).\nTo avoid that, we must make “and Jane Doe in the introduction to” the prefix of the second citation, @smight_j:2018:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones 2019; and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith 2018).\n\nas much [e.g., @jones_j:2017; and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018].\n\nThis is seen by pandoc as:\n[prefix, @jones_j:2017; anotherprefix @smith_j:2018].\n\nRemark that we get ; rather than , in between the citations. Compare:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018).\n\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017; and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018).\n\n\nSome might prefer the first. But this is a small cost and one could argue that the second is more systematic.\nPreferred\nThe preferred method is to cite Doe’s introduction to Smith (2018) as a reference in its own right:\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (e.g., Jones 2019; John Doe 2018).\n\nas much [e.g., @jones_j:2017; @doe_j:2018].\n\nThis requires an adding to the entry in the bibliography. The entry is a book section authored by Doe is a book authored (not edited) by Smith. Entering it in Zotero and exporting as Bibtex gives us the code:\n@inbook{doe_j:2018,\n    author = {Doe, John},\n    title = {Introduction},\n    booktitle = {An imaginary book},\n    bookauthor = {Smith, John},\n    publisher = {Ideas Press},\n    address = {Mainville},\n    year = {2018}\n}\n\n\n24.2.4 Example: Citation in parenthesis with interfering syntax\nOriginal\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (see, e.g., Jones (2017); I speak simply in terms of states of affairs, as for present purposes nothing hinges on this).\n\n\nIf we typeset it as usual, with square brackets, it will look like this:\nOthers have granted him as much [see, e.g., @jones_j:2017; I speak simply in terms of states of affairs, as for present purposes nothing hinges on this].\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much [see, e.g., Jones (2019); I speak simply in terms of states of affairs, as for present purposes nothing hinges on this].\n\n\nProposed\nThe semi-colon (;) separates different references. Since there isn’t a second reference, the whole reference isn’t recognised as a reference in parenthesis. To avoid this, we can replace the semi-colon for an em-dash, if the context allows for that. Otherwise, we need to reformulate the text.\n\n\nOthers have granted him as much (see, e.g., Jones 2019—I speak simply in terms of states of affairs, as for present purposes nothing hinges on this).\n\n\n\n\n\nDoe, Jane. 2019. “Another Imaginary Article.” Review of Ideas 9: 7–47. https://doi.org/10.0000/123456789.\n\n\n———. 2020. “An Imaginary Article.” Review of Ideas 10: 13–27. https://doi.org/10.0000/123456789.\n\n\nDoe, John. 2018. “Introduction.” In An Imaginary Book, by John Smith.

    "text": "25.6 BibTeX file guidance\nThis only applies to BibTeX (.bib) files. If you’re using CSL Json files, you are probably generating them from Zotero or some other bibliography manager instead.\n\n25.6.1 Edit BibTeX files\nSeveral methods:\n\nEdit the .bib file directly in a text editor. Either:\n\n\nfix manually what is wrong with the entry.\ndelete the entry, search and add it again with the same method as when you miss a reference (see below).\n\n\nUse a BibTeX editor (BibDesk, comes with TeXshop on Macos, or JabRef).\nUse a bibliography manager like Zotero that imports / exports BibTeX files. Beware: Zotero and others convert the .bib file into their own formats on import. This means that you may lose of your bib file’s features: with Zotero, \\cite commands (that a BibTeX file may use to cite some entries in other entries) are lost.\n\n\n\n25.6.2 Check BibTeX file formatting\nYou can use biber (LaTeX’s bibliography generator) to check a BibTeX file for errors. Run on the terminal:\nbiber --tool references.bib\n\nThis prints out a report on any problem in the file. It also creates a cleaned-up version of the file, as references_bibtools.bib.\n\n\n25.6.3 BibTeX field names aren’t case-sensitive\nBibTeX field names are not case-sensitive: they can be named “author”, or “Author”, or “AUTHOR”.\n@inbook{Jakobson:1980,\n  Author = {Jakobson, Roman},\n  Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}\n}\n\nIs the same as:\n@inbook{Jakobson:1980,\n  author = {Jakobson, Roman},\n  TITLE = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}\n}\n\n\n25.6.4 Title capitalization\nTraditionally, in English bibliographies titles in English are typeset in title case (“An Article with Results”) but titles in other languages are typeset in sentence case (“An article with results”). In German or French bibliographies, all titles (including those of works in English) are in sentence case.1\nThe appearance is controlled by our bibliography template. For this to work entries in the the BibTeX file must:\n\nHave a langid field specifying the entry’s language as an IETF language tag: en, en-US, de, etc.2 Though (at least some) full names like english or french will work too. If there is no\nlangid field for a given BibTeX entry, the entry is assumed to be in the language of the document (as specified in the document’s metadata, lang field).\nHave titles in sentence case, that is, where only names and words that need to be capitalized no matter what are in upper case. For instance, “The philosophy of logical atomism” or “Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen”.\n\n\nIf an entry uses title case (“Rezension der Schrift von…”), the capitals will be assumed to be mandatory and will be printed even when it should be in sentence case. Thus if you know that your bibliography entries in English will always be printed in title case (i.e., your publication is in English and you’re sure it won’t adopt the APA sentence case convention), then it’s harmless to use title case in the BibTeX file itself. But when in doubt sentence case + langid field is the safe option.\nFor an illustration:\n@article{Tarski1936,\n    author = {Alfred Tarski},\n    title = {Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen},\n    journal = {Studia Philosophica},\n    volume = {1},\n    pages = {261--405},\n    year = {1936},\n    langid = {de},\n}\n@article{Russell1905,\n    author = {Bertrand Russell},\n    title = {On denoting},\n    journal = {Mind},\n    volume = {14},\n    number = {56},\n    pages = {479--493},\n    year = {1905},\n  langid = {en},\n}\n\nFor more detail:\n\nthe langid field is a biblatex field name. It is recognized by Pandoc’s citeproc (Pandoc’s internal citation processor) for use in a association with a CSL style file.\nThere is a language field in BibTeX files too. But it is not meant to affect an entry’s format; rather, it is used for entries to explicitly state its language](ttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/323441/how-does-langid-field-in-biblatex-differ-from-language-field) affect the formal of the bibliography.\n\n\n\n25.6.5 Original year of publication\nIf the author isn’t using the original edition of a book, e.g. citing from a 2010 edition of Locke’s 1689 essay, add a field origdate in the bibtex entry. (will not show up in the PDF at the moment, but our final template will do it). Ex:\n@inbook{Jakobson:1980,\n  Author = {Jakobson, Roman},\n  Booktitle = {The Framework of Language},\n  Location = {Ann Arbor},\n  Year = {1980}\n  Origdate = {1956},\n  Pages = {81\\--92},\n  Publisher = {University of Michigan Press},\n  Shorttitle = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem},\n  Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}\n}\n\nSee biblatex documentation, §2.2.2 on data fields.\n\n\n25.6.6 BibTeX conventions and resources\nThere are two BibTeX standards that can be used:\n\nBibTeX\nBibLaTeX\n\n\nThe two conventions overlap a lot (most of the field names are common). The BibLaTeX conventions are more recent and complete. The BibTeX ones are widely used, and almost entirely compatible with BibLaTeX. Each corresponds to a LaTeX bibliography processor (bibtex and biber, respectively). Both are understood by Pandoc’s bibliography processor, citeproc.\nWhere to find references on these BibTeX standards?\n\nBibTeX. The BibTeX original documentation (1988), Paperpile’s BibTeX guide.\nBibLaTeX. The BibLaTeX official documentation and the BibLaTeX cheatsheet.\n\n\nNote: if you have a full LaTeX installation on your computer you will have access to some of these documents from your terminal using the texdoc command. Try the commands:\ntexdoc biblatex\n\ntexdoc biblatex-cheatsheet\n\ntexdoc bibtex\n\nDialectica guideline. We use the biblatex conventions.\n\n\n25.6.7 BibTeX file special entry types\n\n25.6.7.1 Unpublished manuscript\nChoose the type unpublished. Add a note field:\n  note = {unpublished manuscript}\n\nAdd a URL if available.\nDialectica guideline. We require a URL. If the author cannot provide a URL, we do not create a bibliography entry at all but only describe the source in a footnote (“in an unpublished manuscript titled”XXX”).",

For instance, the DOI “10.1007/15.12345” copied from the web may end up being pasted as “10.1007%2F15.12345”.\nThese DOIs crash Pandoc version 3.0.1 and lower, but the bug will be fixed in future releases.\n\n\n25.7.3 Error message: \\citet unknown command\nRequires: script or filter that manages recursive bibliography management .\nPandoc encounters a LaTeX citation command (\\citet or the like). Unless you or the author has written one in the text, it is in the .bib file.3\nSolution 1. In Dialectica, LaTeX citation commands in the .bib file are processed. This is achieved by a script that runs pandoc on the document twice, first to generate a json that includes the biblio, second to generate the final output (at which state the latex commands in the biblio are processed). The first run is --to json and the second with -M suppress-bibliography. Suggested by John MacFarlane on pandoc-discuss.\nSolution 1. Replace the offending \\citet command(s) in your .bib file. To find it or them:\n\nprocess the markdown with .tex output.\nsearch \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in.\ngo to the .bib file and replace the \\citet{jones_a:2020} in that entry with e.g. Jones (2020), and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above)\n\n\nSolution 2. Implement a double-pass generation procedure. This is the publisher’s job.\n\nWe have now figured out a method to process those command. However, we’ll need to update the document-generation procedure to implement it. Either wait for it, or use solution 1.\nin a field of your .bib file is printed out. It needs to be replaced. To find it:\n\nprocess the markdown with .tex output.\nsearch \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in.\ngo to the .bib file and replace the \\citet{jones_a:2020} in that entry with e.g. Jones (2020), and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above)\n\n\nExplanation. Pandoc doesn’t process it (at least, not if the field is “title”, and perhaps not in general), leaves the \\citet command. At the LaTeX stage it’s not recognized by LaTeX (because we don’t load natbib).\n\n\n\n25.7.4 From Frege to gödel\nMystery.

For instance, this:\n\n\nThe principle of non-contradition, \\(\\lnot (\\phi \\land \\lnot \\phi)\\) is Leibniz’s…\n\n\nis coded:\nThe principle of non-contradition, $\\lnot (\\phi \\land \\lnot \\phi)$ is\nLeibniz's...\n\nA “display” formula, one that occupies more than one line, is delimited by $$ signs. For instance, this:\n\n\nLeibniz’s law, \\[\\forall x \\forall y (x=y \\rightarrow \\forall X\n(Xx \\leftrightarrow Xy))\\] is …\n\n\nis coded:\nLeibniz's law, $$\\forall x \\forall y (x=y \\rightarrow \\forall X \n(Xx \\leftrightarrow Xy))$$ is ... \n\nDisplay formulas are ‘block’ elements. For more or them, in particular, numbering them, see the Equations.\nDo not leave a space after the opening $ or before the closing one, otherwise markdown thinks they are ordinary dollar signs.\n\nGOOD: $\\forall x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$\nBAD: $ \\forall x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx) $\n\n\nCan pandoc confuse ordinary dollar signs and formula delimiters? Normally not. In the following:\n\nAmounts of $20,000 and $30,000 are...\n\n\nPandoc will not think that $20,000 and $ is a formula, because the last $ is preceded by a space. If, however, for some reason you need to typeset something like:\n\nAmounts of $20,000 and 0.00$ are...\n\n\nwhere Pandoc will turn into a formula, “escape” the dollar signs:\nAmounts of \\$20,000 and 0.00\\$ are...\n\n\nAmounts of $20,000 and 0.00$ are…\n\n\n\n26.2.2 Good practices\nDo not break up a formula apart into its individual symbols. For instance, this:\n\n\nThe formulas \\(\\exists x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\), \\(\\forall x\\neg\\text{Gx}\\) are quantified formulas.\n\n\nShould be entered in markdown as:\nThe formulas $\\exists x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$, $\\forall x\\neg\\text{Gx}$\nare quantified formulas.\n\nNot as:\nThe formulas $\\exists$ x (Fx $\\rightarrow$ Gx), $\\forall$ x$\\neg$Gx\nare quantified formulas.\n\nDo not enter a list of formulas as a single formula (with exceptions). Merging two formulas into one prevents linbreaks between them in the output:\n\nGOOD: $\\exists x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$, $\\forall x \\lnot Gx$.\nBAD: $\\exists x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx), \\forall x \\lnot Gx$.\n\n\nException: if you have lists of small items as in \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots , p_n\\), no need to split those into many equations:\n\nGOOD: $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$1\nALSO GOOD: $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$.\n\n\nAnother exception, list of premises in a formula stating that they entail a conclusion:\n\n\n\\(A, B, \\vDash C\\)\n\n\nGOOD: $A, B, \\vDash C$\nBAD: $A$, $B$, $vDash C$\n\n\nThe latter might look right but it is not accurate in e.g. a machine-readable JATS XML export, as the whole line here should be treated as a single claim (that \\(A\\),\\(B\\) entail \\(C\\)), not three claims (\\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(\\vDash C\\)).\nElements of formulas repeated in the text are entered as formulas too. For instance this:\n\n\nIn the formula \\(\\exists xFx\\) the variable \\(x\\) is bound.\n\n\nis coded thus:\n\nGOOD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable $x$ is...\nBAD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable x is...\nBAD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable *x* is...\n\n\nNote that *x* is not in formula mode and not a suitable replacement for $x$ here. While both would be displayed in italics, their meaning is different (on indicates emphasis, the other indicates an element of a formula) and they are subtle differences in typesetting (different font and spacing for formulas). Similarly:\n\n\nIf a subject \\(S\\) has property \\(P\\)\n\n\nGOOD: If a subject $S$ has property $P$...\nBAD: If a subject S has property P...\nBAD: If a subject *S* has property *P*...\nBAD: If a subject **S** has property **P**...\n\n\nOrdinary text within formulas. Some authors put ordinary text within formulas:\n\\(\\exists\\Phi(\\textrm{All }\\Phi\\textrm{ one})\\)\nYou should put that text within the formula LaTeX code, using \\textrm{...} for normal text, and \\textit{...} for italic, \\textbf{...} for bold, \\texttt{...} for code.\n\nBAD: ($\\exists\\Phi$)(All $\\Phi$ One)\nGOOD: $(\\exists\\Phi)(\\textrm{All} \\Phi \\textrm{One})$\n\n\nThis makes more sense (the first is one formula, the second is two mixed with the text) and the spacing will be better.\n\n\n26.2.3 Display formulas and punctuation\nShould we use period and commas after display equations, as if there were normal parts of a sentence?\n\n… as in the famous equation: \\[\nE = mc^2\n\\].\n\nBoth conventions exist.\nDialectica guidelines. Our preference is to treat them as part of a sentence. That seems to be the dominant convention in maths. But we don’t actively modify manuscripts to impose it.",

They’re a bit more spaced than inline ones, but that looks better. If, for some reasons, inline bussproofs are required, we would imagify them.\n\n26.7.1 Inline bussproofs\nMathjax does not display inline bussproofs. So prefer block ones wherever possible. If you must use an inline proof, you have two options.\n\nUse the Imagify to convert the proof to image in HTML output.\nReplace any $...$ math delimitors in the proof with \\(...\\), and wrap the proof within $...$. If you do this, the HTML output will display a warning message where the proof would have been. If you don’t, you will get nothing at all or a confusing mix of LaTeX code and error message such as ...A\\(}\\UnaryInfC{\\)AExtra close brace or missing open...\n\n\n(Dialectica-specific). We strongly prefer block proofs. We imagify any proof that doesn’t display correctly.\nIllustration of option 2. Suppose you have the Inline proof:\n\\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$)}\n\\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n\\DisplayProof\n\nYou should rewrite it as:\n$\\AxiomC{\\(P \\land Q\\)}\n\\UnaryInfC{\\(Q\\)}\n\\DisplayProof$\n\n\n26.7.2 Block bussproofs\nRequires: Pandoc 2.19.3+. Enter the prooftree environment directly in markdown, surrounded by empty lines, without enclosing $$...$$:\n... as can be seen in the following deduction:\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(P \\land Q\\)}\n\\UnaryInfC{\\(Q\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\n\\noident which proves $Q$ from premise $P\\land Q$.\n\nIt should display correctly in HTML output. The \\noindent command at the beggining of the next paragraph ensures that no first line indentation is added.\nExceptions: some commands like \\doubleline aren’t handled by MathJaX.

With this update we should be able to enter the prooftree environments without the surrounding $$..$$. (to be tested).)\nWith prooftree environments we face the following problem:\n\nIf we include the LaTeX directly in the source, it’s not printed at all in HTML output:\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{\\(P \\land Q\\)}\n\\UnaryInfC{\\(Q\\)}\n\\end{prooftree}\nIf we enclose it within `$$...$$, it is passed to the HTML output and then correctly displayed by MathJax.

We provide two versions of the prootree environment, one for formats other than LaTeX, one for LaTeX. This is done as follows:\n::: {.not-in-format .latex}\n $$\\begin{prooftree}\n  \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n  \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n\\end{prooftree}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.only-in-format .latex}\n\\begin{prooftree}\n  \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n  \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n:::\n\nWithin prooftree environements there’s no need to replace the $...$ with \\(...\\).\nThe not-in-format and only-in-format Divs can contain any markdown content, including a mix of LaTeX and markdown if needed. For isntance, your proofs may be in numbered example lists:\n::: {.not-in-format .latex}\n(@) $$\\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.only-in-format .latex}\n(@) \\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}\n:::\n\nAnd if you have several proofs in a row, you don’t need to have two Divs for each, you can have two Divs overall:\n::: {.not-in-format .latex}\n1.   $$\\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}$$\n2.   $$\\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$P\\lor Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.only-in-format .latex}\n1.   \\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}\n2.   \\begin{prooftree}\n      \\AxiomC{$P$}\n      \\UnaryInfC{$P\\lor Q$}\n    \\end{prooftree}\n\n:::",

    "text": "27.1.1 When is imagify needed?\nYou see red text in the HTML output corresponding to some LaTeX code in the original. E.g. \\llbracket in red.\n\n\n27.1.2 Imagify with default settings or specific settings\nYou’ll have to figure out whether you can imagify with default settings alone or whether you need specific settings. Simply try the default settings first, and move to specific ones if that doesn’t work.\nDefault settings work e.g. when you have a bussproof that uses doubleLine, a table, or a Tikz image. Specific settings are required e.g. when the LaTeX uses symbols found in a extra package (double brackets from the stmaryrd package).\nSpecific settings may also be used to fine-tune the image: its vertical alignment, or size (zoom).\n\n\n27.1.3 Imagifying with default settings\nCreate a Div with class imagify:\n\n::: {.imagify} \n\nMixed content here.\n\n:::\n\nThe Div can contain a mix of text and LaTeX elements. So you don’t need to place your Div exactly around the LaTeX bit that needs to be converted, you can take e.g. the paragraph that contains it.\nWithin the Div, any LaTeX element is converted to a separate image:\n\nEvery math formula ($...$, /(.../), $$...$$, /[.../])\nEvery raw LaTeX element, block or inline:\n`...inline latex...`{=latex}\n\n```{=latex}\n...block latex...\n```\nEvery LaTeX command directly inserted into the text:\n... (end of some paragraph).\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n... (begining of some other paragraph)\n\n\nBy default, images are embedded within the HTML document. But Imagify options allow you to save them as separate files instead.\nTikZ. Tikz images start with \\begin{tikzpicture} (sometimes preceeded with \\usetikzlibrary{...}). They should work with default settings. However, you sometimes need to check which “libraries” are loaded. Suppose the original manuscript (in LaTeX) has a preamble with either of the following commands:\n\\usepackage[arrows]{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows}\n\nThen the document is loading a “package” for TikZ images, the arrows package. You need to tell Imagify that it’s used in your particular image. To do so you add the \\usetikzlibrary command at the beginning of the LaTeX code itself:\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}...\n\n\n27.1.4 Imagify with specific settings\nYou may use specific Imagify settings instead. The best way to do so is to declare an Imagify “class” in the document’s metadata:\nimagify-classes:\n  myclass:\n    header-includes: |\n      \\usepackage{stmaryrd}\n    zoom: 1.6\n\nHere we declare an imagifying class myclass. It uses the LaTeX package stmaryrd (with provides a bunch of symbols like double brackets) and an extra zoom of 1.6 (default is 1.5 or 1.4). You can then use the class by putting content in a Div of that class:\n\n::: myclass\n\n... Mixed content (LaTeX elements here are imagified with those settings)\n\n:::\n\nIt that helps clarity you can also declare the Div both of imagify and myclass:\n\n::: {.myclass .imagify}\n\n...\n\n:::\n\n(Recall that when multiple identifier/classes/attributes are declared we need to use curly brackets and dots at the beginning of classes.)\nClass names rules. It’s a good idea to use if you use “imagify” in the name, perhaps with the name of the author (imagify-smith) or a name related to the particular element to be imagified (imagify-bussproofs). Important: avoid name clashes between two papers in the same issue. E.g. two papers with the same imagify-table class but different class settings in each.\nHow to find out which packages are needed. Sometimes it’s obvious which LaTeX package is needed from the original LaTeX manuscript.\nOften the missing LaTeX is a symbol.Look at the command(s) that are printed in red in HTML output. Suppose you see the \\\\llbracket command, for instance. A good idea is to check whether this command is in the LaTeX Comprehensive Symbols List:\n\nrun texdoc symbols on a Terminal. If you have a rich enough LaTeX distribution installed this will open the LaTeX Comprehensive Symbols List (a large PDF). Otherwise search for it online.\nsearch in the document for your command, e.g. search for llbracket.\nif it shows up, it’ll be in a Table. The table caption tells you which LaTeX package contains the symbol, e.g. “Table 225: stmaryrd Variable-sized Delimiters” tells me that \\llbracket is part of the stmaryrd package.\n\n\nWhen you figure out which LaTeX package is needed to imagify your bit of LaTeX, add it to the relevant imagify class with header-includes.\nSpecifying settings on the Div itself. You can also specify Imagify settings on the Div itself:\n::: {.imagify zoom=\"1.6\" }\n\n...\n\n:::\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot use this to specify LaTeX packages. The following:\n::: {.imagify header-includes=\"\\usepackage{stmaryrd}\" }\n\nis converted by Pandoc into “usepackage{stmaryrd}”, i.e. a backslash symbol followed by the text ‘usepackage’ rather than the actual LaTeX command \\usepackage.\nCascading styles. Imagify settings are applied in a “cascading” order: first the defaults, then those associated with a Div’s class, then those specified on the Div itself. The latter ones override the former.\nIf a LaTeX element is contained within an imagify-class Div that is itself contained in another imagify-class Div, then the settings (class and local) of the first are applied first, then those of the contained one. And so on for multiple containment.",

    "text": "27.2 Advanced usage\n\n27.2.1 See the LaTeX document used to generate an image\nImagify uses Pandoc’s default LaTeX template to create a document of the standalone class that contains your LaTeX element’s code.\n\nSeveral packages are already included: amsmath, amssymb, etc.\nYour header-includes code is included. To prevent that, set an alternative Imagify header-includes empty in your doc metadata:\nheader-includes: |\n  ... document header-includes ...\nimagify:\n  header-includes: |\n  ... header-includes used by Imagify ...\n\n\nTo see these intermediate LaTeX files, set imagify’s debug option in your document’s metadata:\nimagify:\n  debug: true\n\nThey will be placed in the document folder, or if the folder specified by Imagify’s output-folder option:\nimagify:\n  output-folder: imagify_files\n\nIf Imagify conversion crashes, you can open these files in an editor and figure out which modifications (e.g. additional packages) are needed to make it work.\n\n\n27.2.2 TikZ\nIf \\begin{tikzpicture} or usetikzlibrary appears within the imagified code, Imagify will handle it well.\nIf your code uses TikZ indirectly (e.g., it uses a package that loads TikZ), you normally have to set the tikz classoption:\nimagify:\n  classoption: tikz\n\n\n27.2.3 Additional packages\nYou can use Imagify’s header-includes to provide any LaTeX packages an image needs:\nheader-includes: |\n  ... document header-includes ...\nimagify:\n  header-includes: |\n     ... header-includes used by Imagify ...\n\n\n27.2.4 Imagify classes\nYou can create multiple imagify classes with different options. This allows you to provide different packages for different images:\nimagify:\n  classes:\n    fitchproof:\n      header-includes: |\n        ```{=latex}\n        \\usepackage{fitch}\n        ```\n    bussproof:\n      header-includes: |\n        ```{=latex}\n        \\usepackage{bussproofs}\n        ```\n\nAll of Imagify’s rendering options (zoom, pdf-engine, embed, etc.) work under these classes too.",

    "text": "28.2 If PDF generation doesn’t work\nMake sure first that you’ve checked the advice in the “how to produce outputs” sections.\nPDF generation happens in two stages. Identify which one fails:\n\nMarkdown to LaTeX (the Pandoc stage)\nor LaTeX to PDF (the LaTeX stage)\n\n\nYou do so by trying to generate a LaTeX (.tex) output. If that fails, there’s an error at the Pandoc stage, otherwise (more commonly, unfortunately) the error is at the latex stage.\nPandoc-stage errors are mostly due to:\n\nFaulty YAML metadata.\n\nYAML parse exception at line 453.. your YAML is not well formatted. See the metadata section.\nEven if you don’t get the YAML parse error, there might be some formatting error around line breaks or identation. Check multiline fields and nested fields of maps/lists.\nSome YAML value isn’t correct and makes a filter crash.\n\nFile not found. File not found in resource path error, see below.\nA bug in one of the “filters” that we use to handle various typesetting tasks (e.g. statements). You will see the name lua in the error message.\nFaulty LaTeX template. Cannot compile the template error. There’s an error in the house template.\n\n\nLaTeX stage errors are due to a multitude of causes. You can learn more about the error by running your pdf engine on the LaTeX output:\nlualatex article.tex\n\nFor lualatex; replace with pdflatex or xelatex depending on your setup.\nOnce you run LaTeX a detailed log of its action rolls out—faster than you can read. The error message will be close to the end and look like this:\nError/Warning (...) Error: MESSAGE\n\nType  H &lt;return&gt;  for immediate help.\n ...                                              \n                                                  \nl.3984       {See the manual for further details.}\n\nThe l.3984 is the line of the LaTeX file where the error arose. (Not necessarily the line that caused it! The cause might be earlier in the code, though not later.) You can go to that location in your LaTeX file and investigate.\nYou can place the LaTeX run log in a file if you want to examine it in a text editor rather than the terminal:\nlualatex article.tex &gt; latex_log.txt",

    "text": "30.1 Setting up your system\nDialectica outputs are compiled: from a markdown manuscript, image files, bibliography files and Dialectica’s template (itself a collection of files), it creates PDFs and HTML outputs. The compilation environment is the collection of software tools to do this: Pandoc, LaTeX, Quarto, and a few others. Instead of asking everybody to install these tools on their various Linux/Windows/Mac machines, and asking everybody to update them to the same version, we are using a “containerized” environment that is the same for all, no matter which machine you have.\nLet’s briefly explain how this works, including key terms. In the old days, computers came with an ‘installation disk/DVD/USB key’ that had your computer system (Windows, Mac, Linux) and perhaps some basic software (a text editor). Using the disk/DVD/USB key, you set up the system on the machine, and then used the computer. And in the old days, you’d give each copyeditor a computer of the same model, with the same installation disk/DVD/USB key. We’re doing to do exactly that, except that our company computer is virtual and will be simulated by your own computer. The Docker application is the software that enables to do that.\nThe Docker application works with images and containers. We’ll have:\nOnce your container (virtual company computer) is created, it can be started or stopped. This is just like turning the company computer on and off.\nThe container (virtual company computer) is isolated from your actual system and filesystem, so it doesn’t change anything in your system, it doesn’t crash your system if it crashes, and you won’t see its internal files on your file browser.\nThere is one exception though: the container will have access to the dialectica workshouse folder on your own filesystem. That allows it to read manuscript markdown files, bibliography files, etc. in order to generate outputs, and then to write the generated outputs (PDF or HTML files) in your filesystem so you can view them.\nMoreover, in the advanced text editor we’ll use (Visual Studio Code aka VSCode), you’ll be able to run a Terminal on the container (virtual company machine) itself. This allows you to tell the container to generate outputs.\nDialectica copyediting requires:\nBriefly put, to set up, you need to install git and docker, and then be able to connect to a running container.  In this guide, we’ll use VSCode  as it makes it very easy to work inside docker containers , but you’re free to work in a different editor and use the container directly from your terminal if you wish.\nHow to setup will depend on your specific Operating System. If you know how to install and configure git, docker and VSCode on your own, just skip this section and go chapter 3. Note that in this guide, VSCode replaces RStudio as an alternative better suited to interact with modern software tools (such as docker) and languages other than R (such as Markdown, LaTeX, and HTML).\nFor guidance or any problem not covered here, please contact Luis Bordo at luis.bordo@philosophie.ch.",

    "text": "Docker, to run a container containing the actual environment\nGit, to clone the repository of the script to download and start the compilation environment\nRecommended: VSCode, to comfortably connect and use the environment to edit articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.1.1 Installing git, docker, VSCode\nThe following instructions need to be executed only once per machine. Here we will install and set up Docker, Git, and VSCode in your machine.\n\n30.1.1.1 Windows\n\nDownload and install git\nCheck that git is working in PowerShell. If you get no errors with the command below, then git is working correctly:\ngit --version\nDownload, install, and open Docker Desktop. When installing Docker, choose the option to use WSL 2.\nWhen you install Docker, you can use the recommended settings and select “Continue without signing in”.\nOpen PowerShell (you have it installed by default) and check that you have wsl version 2 or above with\nwsl --version\n\n\nIf you don’t, do wsl --install, wait, and do again wsl --version\nIf you still don’t have wsl version 2 or above, go to the Troubleshooting section below\n\n\nCheck that Docker is configured to run with WSL 2: open Docker Desktop, go to Settings, and mark the checkbox for using WSL 2 if it’s not marked already.\nAdditionally, in the settings, increase the CPU and memory limits of the containers to be at a minimum of 3/4 of your machine’s resources. For example, if you have an 8 core CPU and 16 GB of RAM, you could set the limits to 7 cores and 14 GB of RAM.\nNow, in PowerShell, check that docker is working with:\ndocker run hello-world\n\n\nIf you don’t get any errors, then docker is working in your machine\n\nInstall VSCode\n\n\n\n30.1.1.2 Mac\n\nInstall brew\n\n\nFor this, usually it’s a single command to execute in a terminal; just follow the instructions in the page\n\n\nInstall git using brew. In a terminal, do:\nbrew install git\nCheck that git is working, in a terminal. If you get no errors with the command below, then git is working correctly:\ngit --version\nDownload and install Docker Desktop. Make sure to pick your correct processor (Mac Intel Chip or Mac Apple Chip). 1\nWhen you install Docker, you can use the recommended settings and select “Continue without signing in”.\nConfigure Docker. Launch the Docker application and open “Settings”.\n\nIn the “General” tab, check that the following options are enabled: “VirtioFS”, “Use Virtualization framework”, and “Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon”. (These settings may not appear on Intel Chip macs; if they don’t ignore this step.)\nIncrease the CPU and memory limits of the containers to be at a minimum of 3/4 of your machine’s resources. For example, if you have an 8 core CPU and 16 GB of RAM, you could set the limits to 7 cores and 14 GB of RAM.\n\nCheck that docker is working. In a terminal, run:\ndocker run hello-world\nIf you get no errors, Docker is working correctly. If you do, try running Docker (in Applications). Docker’s whale icon should appear in your system icon bar (i.e. alongside icons for Wifi, Bluetooth etc.).\nDownload and install VSCode\n\n\n\n30.1.1.3 Linux\n\nInstall git\n\n\nYou most likely have it by default already. You can test this by doing git --version in a terminal\nIf you don’t have it, install it using your distribution’s package manager. For example, in Debian and Ubuntu (and their derivatives), do sudo apt install git in a terminal\n\n\nFollow [the official installation instructions for Docker] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#server) to install Docker Engine in your Linux distribution\n\n\nFollow the post-installation steps to use docker in your terminal without needing to write sudo everytime\nIf you opt out from following these post-installation steps, you will need to adapt the docker comands in this document (i.e., append sudo to all of them, everytime)\nYou can use Docker without siging in.\n\n\nCheck that docker is working, in a terminal. If you get no errors with the command below, then docker is working correctly:\ndocker run hello-world\nInstall VSCode\n\n\n\n\n30.1.2 Setup: pulling the docker image and starting a container\nOnce you have the necessary dependencies (git, docker, VSCode) are up and running on your machine, we proceed by using a script made to automatically download the latest version of the docker image containing the compilation environment, and start it.  The terminal commands below should work in any shell in any operating system (PowerShell in Windows, zsh in Mac, bash in Linux).\nNote that these instructions are the same as the ones in the repository’s README. Make sure that you have at least 10 GB of free space in your machine:\n\nUsing a terminal, first clone the git repository where the start script is:  \n# cd to your preferred location. For example:\n# mkdir ~/gitrepos\n# cd ~/gitrepos\ngit clone https://github.com/Philosophie-ch/dltc-env\ncd dltc-env\n\nNow copy the .env.template file into .env and edit its contents:\ncp .env.template .env\ncode .env\nThis will open the file .env in VSCode. In VSCode you may see a message “Git repositories were found… do you want to open them?”, you can close it or ignore it.\nNOTE: you can navigate with your usual file explorer to the “dltc-env” folder, which will be located where you cloned it in step 1 (namely, within your Github folder). If you use the file explorer, you will however not immediately see the .env. To see it in the file explorer, you need to enable viewing hidden files. The way to do this depends on which system you are using. On the other hand, if you are viewing the contents of dltc-env in the VSCode text editor (for isntance, if you typed the code .env command above), the file explorer within VSCode will show you the .env files. If you are viewing the files that way, you do not need to enable viewing hidden files.\nThe contents of .env look like this:\nARCH=\"amd64\"  # put \"arm64\" if on an Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, etc.; non-Intel)\nDLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY=\"/YOUR/PATH/TO/Dropbox/philosophie-ch/dltc-workhouse\"\nDOCKERHUB_TOKEN=\"token_in_the_institutional_setup_page\"\nThis is a key-value file. ARCH, DLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY, DOCKERHUB_TOKEN are keys, and the strings within quotes, amd64, /YOUR/PATH..., “token_in_the…” are their values. You need to put the values appropriate to your local system. You should set the values as follows, and save the file:\n2.1 ARCH: the “architecture” of your machine. If you are on a Windows machine, a Linux machine, or a Mac with Intel chips (not Apple Silicon), leave this to amd64. If you have a Mac with Apple Silicon chip, set it to arm64.\n2.2 DLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY: the full path, on your local machine, to the dltc-workhouse folder inside Dropbox. Here’s one way to get it. Open a Terminal. Navigate (using cdcommands ) to that folder, and run the command pwd (‘present working directory’). It will display the full path to that folder, e.g. /Users/janedoe/Dropbox/Philosophie-ch/dltc-workhouse/ on a Mac.\n2.3 DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: the login token (not the “password”) for the dockerhub account. You can find it in the “Institutional set-up” page in our Google Drive, “Passwords” section.\nDo not forget to save .env when you have done this.\nNow you can execute the start script. From the folder dltc-env, in Linux and Mac run:\n./dltc-env-start.sh\n(Equivalently: sh dltc-env-start.sh. When a file is a script, for safety reasons it cannot be launched just by typing the file name, you have to either launch the shell script executor sh followed by the name of the script, or, you have to precede the script by its path. Since here, the script dltc-env-start.sh is in your current folder, the path to it is: ./. The dot is the current folder, and the slash separates the folder name, ., from the script file name, dltc-env-start.sh. This is why the full path is ./dltc-env-start.sh.)\nOn Windows, run:\n.\\dltc-env-start.ps1\n(The idea is as before, . is the current folder and \\ the (Windows-style) separator. There is probably an equivalent such as ps dltc-env-start.ps1 but I don’t know it.)\n\n\nThe last command downloads an “image” of Dialectica’s “compilation environment” (a mini Linux system containing Pandoc, LaTeX and other utilities), and it runs this image in a mini-machine simulated by your computer called a Docker “container”. The first time you execute this command it will take a while as it needs to download the image, which is about 5-10Gb. But this will only happen the first time it’s used, and where there are updates of the images online.\nIf the compilation environment starts correctly, you will see a message like the following:\nLogged in to Docker Hub as philosophiech\n\nlatest-arm64: Pulling from philosophiech/dltc-env\nce9ebea987c2: Pull complete \n42ca1070b43f: Pull complete \n3d93737c6ee5: Pull complete \n...\n61e48dddaaa9: Pull complete \nDigest: sha256:bc24161a6b997899ce3881246ee17a4aeae03e6885ab77e1b18cdb2092dc2248\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for philosophiech/dltc-env:latest-arm64\ndocker.io/philosophiech/dltc-env:latest-arm64\n\nSuccessfully pulled latest dltc-env image for arm64; now logged out of Docker Hub\n\nStarting dltc-env container, please wait...\n[+] Running 1/2\n⠴ Network dltc-env_default  Created                                     0.5s \n✔ Container dltc-env        Started                                     0.5s \n\n...success!\n\nCareful that the last line success may display even if there was an error! If you encounter one of the errors below, try to fix it and run the script again.\nErrors you may encounter when running the dltc-env-start script:\n\nThe error message: “dltc-env-start: No such file or directory”. Your terminal is not located in the dltc-env folder, itself in your GitHub repositories folder. Use cd commands to change its location to the dltc-env folder.\nThe error message: “DLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY does not exist.”\nIf you get this error there must be something wrong with the path you put as the value of DLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY in the .env file. If you’re not sure what’s wrong, try the steps of finding out the full path of Dialectica’s workhouse folder before, and check you have saved .env.\nThe following error:\n! dltc-env The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested 0.0s \nThis is because the value for ARCH in the .env file is wrong, so the script has downloaded an image that cannot be ran on your machine. Double-check it. Once you have fixed it, you should (1) delete the container and its image and then (2) re-run the script. To delete the container and its image: open the Docker app, go the Containers tab (box-like icon on the left tab), look if the list contains an item named dltc-env, and click the Trash icon next to it; then go to the Images tab (empty cube icon on the left tab), look whether it contains an item named philosphie-ch/dtlc-env and click the Trash icon next to it. If these items don’t show up, you have nothing to delete. Once you’ve deleted any container/image remaining, you can start the script again.\nAn error like the following:\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?\n\nSuccessfully pulled latest dltc-env image for arm64; now logged out of Docker Hub\n\nStarting dltc-env container, please wait...\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?\nCannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?\n\n...success!\n(Note that the “success” messages are incorrect here.) This “Cannot connect to the Docker daemon error” is because Docker (the application that runs the compilation environment ‘image’ in a ‘container’) is not started. Launch the Docker application and try running the dltc-env-start script again.\nAn error message like the following:\nMacBook-Air:dltc-env sannahirvonen$ ./dltc-env-start.sh\nLogged in to Docker Hub as philosophiech\n\nlatest-amd64: Pulling from philosophiech/dltc-env\n29202e855b20: Pull complete \n04c6e9d3a90b: Pull complete \n...\nwrite /var/lib/docker/tmp/GetImageBlob1011053309: input/output error\n\nSuccessfully pulled latest dltc-env image for amd64; now logged out of Docker Hub\n\nStarting dltc-env container, please wait...\n[+] Running 1/1\n✘ Container dltc-env  Error while Removing                               10.3s \nError response from daemon: container 4ccdac99d0fb7b215bebca79fc1b752d14a1e78575efa547b9fd46a1a4dac282: driver \"overlay2\" failed to remove root filesystem: unlinkat /var/lib/docker/overlay2/4d90b7b3fe97f8cb8470efce26625765b4dcc6699b73ee56d041859dc9071f9b: read-only file system\n[+] Running 1/1\n✘ dltc-env Error                                                          0.1s \nError response from daemon: error creating temporary lease: write /var/lib/desktop-containerd/daemon/io.containerd.metadata.v1.bolt/meta.db: input/output error: unknown\n\n...success!\nWe don’t know why this happens. But if it does, try deleting the container and image and restarting the script. To do this, open Docker app. Go the Containers tab (box-like icon on the left tab), look if the list contains an item named dltc-env, and click the Trash icon next to it; then go to the Images tab (empty cube icon on the left tab), look whether it contains an item named philosphie-ch/dtlc-env and click the Trash icon next to it. If these items don’t show up, you have nothing to delete. Once you’ve deleted any container/image remaining, you can start the script again.\nAn error message like the following:\nError response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting \"/host_mnt/Users/janedoe/.gitconfig\" to rootfs at \"/home/copyeditor/.gitconfig\": mount /host_mnt/Users/janedoe/.gitconfig:/home/copyeditor/.gitconfig (via /proc/self/fd/7), flags: 0x5000: not a directory: unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type\nThis is because Git is badly configured. More precisely, you have a .gitconfig folder at the base of your user directory, while .gitconfig should be a file. (It won’t show up in the browser because ‘.xxx’ items are hidden, but you can see it with the option ‘show hidden files’ or by running the ls command in a terminal located at the root of your user directory). We have encoutered this error and we don’t know why it happens.\nWe solved it by removing the folder and creating an empty .gitconfig file. On Linux/MacOS, remove the folder with:\nrm -r ~/.gitconfig\nAnd create an empty .gitconfig file with:\ntouch ~/.gitconfig\n\n\n\n30.1.3 Starting and stopping the compilation environment container\nThe compilation environment that produces output runs in a ‘Docker container’ that can be started or stopped. It’ll stop if you close Docker or restart your computer. Optionally, you can stop the container when you finish working on your copyediting tasks and restart it when you start again. (If you don’t stop it, it won’t slow down your computer in any noticeable way but it’ll use a bit of memory but shouldn’t slow down your computer in a noticeable way.)\nStarting and stopping containers can be done from the terminal or from the Docker app. From the terminal, use:\ndocker stop dltc-env\n\nto stop it, and\ndocker start dltc-env\n\nto start it again.\nFrom the Docker app, go to Containers tab: a box icon on the top left. (Don’t forget to close the Settings if you haven’t.) In the list of containers you should see one called dltc-env. It’s greyed out if stopped, green if started. In the Actions column, there’s a play or stop icon you can use to start or stop it.\n\n\n30.1.4 Setup: VSCode\nWhile not strictly mandatory, it is highly recommended to use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for the copyediting work. VSCode is a modern, general text editor suited for all tasks programming and writing. It has support for state-of-the-art software tools such as Docker, and through its vast market of extensions, provides great support for Markdown, LaTeX, HTML, and Quarto. It is lightweight, not tied to any specific programming or writing language, and doesn’t need specific programming languages installed.\nFor this subsection, it is recommended that you create a GitHub account, and then connect to it in VSCode.2\n\nCreate an account on GitHub.\n\n\nNow set up VSCode. VSCode has a “profile” functionality: you can create distinct profiles, where each profile has its own set of tools (“extensions”). Initially, there’s only the “default” profile. We recommend you create a specific “dialectica copyeditor” profile.\n\nCreate a ‘profile’ to manage the extensions you need for copyediting.\nIn the vertical toolbar to the left, click on the cogwheel (Settings) and choose Profiles &gt; Create profile…\nGive a name to your profile e.g., “dltc-copyediting” and use the default options\n\n\nYou can switch profiles by going to the Settings cogwheel &gt; Profiles.\nNext, we install useful Extensions in this profile.\n\nInstall the “Dev Containers” extension (by Microsoft). On the left toolbar, click on “Extensions” (the cube pile), and search for “Dev Containers”. It should show up with an “Install” button. Install it.\nInstall the “Remote Explorer” extension (by Microsoft). On the left toolbar, click on “Extensions” (the cube pile), search for “Remote Explorer” and install it. (If you don’t see an install button, that means it’s already been automatically installed at the previous step; you can move on to the next step.)\nConnect VSCode to the Dialectica container. This requires that the container is started (see above). On the left bar, you should see a Remote Explorer tab (a screen with the &gt;&lt; logo). Click on it, it display a navigation column on the left. You should find a “Dev Containers” section there, and within it, the dtlc-env container name. (If you don’t already see the name, click on “Dev Containers” to expand it. If after that you still don’t see it, make sure the container is started.) Hover on the dltc-env and click on the right arrow just next to it (“Attach in Current Window”). You get a warning that attaching to a container may execute arbitrary code: accept (“Got it”).\n\n\nThis has ‘connected’ the present VSCode window to the container (i.e., the virtual company computer that runs Dialectica’s compilation environment to generate output).\nFinally, install some extensions that are useful for copyediting in markdown and LaTeX and Quarto, and to preview outputs.\n\nOn the left toolbar, click “Extensions”. Search and install all of the following:\n\n\nLaTeX Workshop (by James Yu)\nMarkdown All in One (by Yu Zhang)\nQuarto (by Quarto)\nHTML Preview (by George Oliveira)\n\n\nOther recommended extensions are:\n\nError Lens (by Alexander)\n\n\n\n\n30.1.5 Optional extra setup: connect VSCode to GitHub\nOptionally, connect VSCode to GitHub. \n\nInstall “GitHub Pull Requests and Issues” extension. On the left toolbar, click on Extensions, and search and install the “GitHub Pull Requests and Issues” extension.\nConnect to your GitHub account. On the left toolbar, look down for ‘Accounts’, and connect to your GitHub account. (If you’re on a public Wifi this may not work; use a private one or your mobile hotspot.)\nThen, clicking again on ‘Accounts’, enable both ‘Settings Sync’ and ‘Turn on Cloud Changes’. This will synchronize your VSCode settings in any device you connect it to your account.\n\nRecommended. Tell VSCode not to report your activity to Microsoft (they spy us enough already). Click on the cogwheel icon at the bottom of the vertical toolbar on the left, and go to “Settings”. On the page that appears, use the search bar at the top to search for “telemetry”, and set the “Telemetry Level” to “off”.\n\n\n\nIf you have a GitHub pro account, we also recommend:\n\nGitHub Copilot (by GitHub)\nGitHub Copilot Chat (by GitHub)\n\n\nIf you have a university student account and email, you can be granted a GitHub pro account for free. Copilot is an AI assistant that can help you code in general, including help you with Markdown and LaTeX, both directly in VSCode when you edit files and in a chat button provided by the Chat extension (that will appear in the left toolbar).\n\n\n30.1.6 Checking that your setup is right\nWhenever you start VSCode:\n\nMake sure that you’re using the profile you created. If you did create a specific profile for dialectica copyediting, you should see an acronym for it (e.g. “DL”) on the Settings cogwheel at the bottom left. If you didn’t and are using the default profile, you’re fine.\nMake sure that the Extensions installed above are installed “inside” the container. This explained below.\nIf you have connected VSCode to GitHub, check that you’re connected to your GitHub account (in “Accounts”), and that you’re using the profile you created (in “Settings &gt;&gt; Profiles”).\n\n\nTo ensure that VSCode Extensions are installed “inside” the container:\n\nClick the “Extensions” button of the left toolbar. Clear any search in the search bar. Now, you will see a “Local - Installed” section that lists the extensions we’ve installed. (Note that this section is collapsible: if there’s a &gt; next to “Local Installed”, click on it to expand.) You might see that some extensions bear a blue label “Install in container”. If they do, click on the label to install these extensions “within” the container. If none shows that label, you’re fine. Beware that you might need to scroll down to review all extensions in the “Local - Installed” section.\nCheck that your current window is “attached” to Dialectica’s container. The bottom of VSCode’s window is a status bar. To its left there is a &gt;&lt; icon that tells what the window is connected to. If it shows &gt;&lt; Container philosophiech/dltc-env..., your window is attached to Dialectica’s container (the virutal company computer that will produce outputs). If it’s just a green &gt;&lt; symbol, it’s not attached. You need to attach it as follows:\n\nClick the “Remote Explorer” (screen with the &gt;&lt; logo) on the left toolbar. It opens a navigation column. At the top you should see a “Dev Containers” section. (It’s collapsible: if you see the &gt; symbol left of “Dev Containers”, click it to expand.) You should see the container named dtlc-env with a green badge. If there’s no green badge on it, the Dialectica container isn’t connected. Click the right arrow right next to dltc-env (it says “Attach in current window” if you hover the mouse pointer over it for a few seconds).\nIf all goes well, after the window reopens you should see &gt;&lt; Container philosophiech/dltc-env... in the bottom status bar, on the left.\n\n\n\n\n30.1.7 Working ‘inside’ a container\nOnce you attached a VSCode window in a container, you’re working inside that container. What does that mean? In VSCode you can run commands on a terminal. Normally, terminal commands are run on your own system. But when a VSCode window is attached to a container, its terminal runs commands on that container—that is, on the virtual company computer we’ve just created.\nThings you do inside the container stay in the container, so even if you broke it nothing bad would happen. The one exception is the dltc-workhouse folder. Within the container, there’s a user home folder than contains a folder called dltc-workhouse folder. That folder is the dialectica folder of your system. It’s shared between your own system and the container. You do not want to damage or delete them. Beware in particular of rm (remove) commands, which deletes files and folders without seeking confirmation.\nNow, let’s view the dltc-workhouse folder in VSCode. On the leftbar select the Explorer icon (a documents icon). You will see an “Open folder” button. It opens a search bar at the top, which should already list some options (namely, folders in the container), including dltc-workhouse. Click on that; the window will reopen and now the Explorer on the left should show you the files within the dltc-workhouse folder.\nThen, let’s try the terminal within VSCode. If you don’t already see the Terminal at the bottom of your VSCode window, go to the menu Terminal &gt; New Terminal. It’ll create one at the bottom. You’ll see a line:\ncopyeditor@dltc-env:~/dltc-workhouse$\n\nThis is a “prompt”: it waits for your to run a command. It consists of three parts: username, here copyeditor (that’s your identifier within the container), current location, here ~/dltc-workhouse and the $ sign (meaning ‘waiting for your command!’). What is the current location? A terminal is always ‘located’ in some folder, this is the place ‘where’ command are run. Here your location is within the container. The ~ is an abbreviation for the user’s home folder; here it is the home folder of the user copyeditor within the container.\nNote: your container is a virtual Linux machine. So, it’s terminal uses Linux / MacOS terminal commands (cd, ls, cp, rm), not the Windows ones (cd but otherwise dir, copy, del).\nSee Appendix A on how to use a terminal, in particular how to navigate to relocate it in a different folder. Note that you can always run:\npwd\n\nTo display the full path of your “present working directory”, that is, the folder the terminal is located at.\nLet’s now try generating an output. Relocate the terminal within an article folder. Choose an article in progress, not a finished one! The article folder should contain a proper master.md file (if you can’t find an article in progress with one, see details below on how to create one). Run:\ndltc-make off1html\n\nThis should generate a HTML output of the article in the same folder. (If in doubt, delete the current HTML output and run the command again.)\nTip. There are several ways you can relocate a VSCode terminal to a specific folder. You can use the cd commands. But you can also use the two following options. Note that these clear up the window, closing any files you might have open, so only use them if you want a clean window:\n\nUse the Explorer (click the Explorer icon on the leftbar), browse the folders, right-click a folder an select “Open in Integrated Terminal”. Note however that this creates a clean window, so it closes any files you have already open in VSCode.\nOpen the folder in question as root folder. Above we’ve opened the dltc-workshouse folder, so VSCode’s Explorer on the left shows you all the folders it contains. You could decide to open some specific issue or article folder as your base folder instead. In the menu select File &gt; Open Folder…. This opens a search bar when you can search and select a folder to open. When the window refreshes with that folder as base folder, your terminal is then located in that folder.\n\n\n\n30.1.8 A warning\nBe careful when you run commands in dltc-workhouse and its subfolders. While the container in general is isolated from your system (hence whatever you change or install in it doesn’t affect your sytem), the exception is the dltc-workhouse, which is the one containing the article files on your system. You do not want to damage or delete them. Beware in particular of rm (remove) commands, which deletes files and folders without seeking confirmation.\nWe can install new tools or modify existing ones in the environment depending on the needs of the copyediting team. Please contact Luis Bordo at luis.bordo@philosophie.ch for any such request.\n\n\n30.1.9 Advanced: using the container directly from a terminal\nAdditionally, if you know what you’re doing, you can start a shell within the container without using VSCode. With this, you can use the terminal directly to compile articles. Altough rather clumsy as an approach, this would allow you to, for example, keep using RStudio to work on copyediting tasks and then compiling the articles separatedly in a terminal using the container.\nFrom anywhere in your system, do:\ndocker exec -ti --volume=\"YOUR/PATH/TO/Dropbox/philosophie-ch/dltc-workhouse:/home/copyeditor/dltc-workhouse\" philosophiech/dltc-env:latest bash\n\nIf this worked properly, you should see your prompt change to copyeditor@dltc-env. Here, you can now navigate to ~/dltc-workhouse, where you will find the usual Dropbox files for copyediting.\nNote that you can execute the command above in an integrated terminal in any other editor (such as RStudio). This will give you a shell inside the container with access to all the tools you need for the copyediting work.\n\n\n30.1.10 Troubleshooting Installation\n\n30.1.10.1 Common issues\n\nProblem: In VSCode, connected to the container, you don’t see any file in ‘dltc-workhouse’ when you open it\n\n\nSolution: this is most likely due to not properly setting your .env file. Go to the folder in which you cloned the GitHub repository for the compilation environment, copy the .env.template file to a new file called .env. Now open this file, and change the value of “DLTC_WORKHOUSE_DIRECTORY” to the full path of where the dltc-workhouse folder (inside Dropbox) is.\nNote that, for Windows, you need to change “\\” for “/” in the path name. That is, if your folder is in “C:\\Users\\…”, you must change it to “C:/Users/…”.\n\nProblem: while working in the container, you see an error with code “-9”, or anything related to being “out of memory”\n\n\nSolution: you’re running a heavy task inside the container, and it’s eating up a lot of resources in your machine, so docker is killing the task. This could happen, for example, when compiling PDFs with the big bibliography file. Go to your Docker settings and allow your containers a higher limit on the CPU (or “cores”) and on “memory” (RAM). At least 3/4 of the highest limit should be enough in most cases, but if it’s not enough you can go up to 100%. Just note that if you do this (allowing 100% use of resources), the task is very intense and you’re on an old computer, your machine could crash.\n\n\n30.1.10.2 Installing WSL version 2 on Windows\nNote: if you don’t feel comfortable modifying the options of your machine’s BIOS or UEFI, get in contact with Luis Bordo at luis.bordo@philosophie.ch to guide you through personally. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.\n\nEnable ‘virtualization’. To do this, we need to go to the computer’s BIOS or UEFI. If you know how to do this, do it as you know and ignore the instructions below. Otherwise, follow these steps. WARNING: this will restart your computer:\n\nGo to Settings\nGo to Update and Security (or a setting with a similar name)\nGo to “Recovery”\nClick on Restart now in the section “Advanced start-up”\n\nClick on “Troubleshoot”\nClick on “Advanced Options”\nClick on on the option that mentions either “UEFI” or “BIOS”\nClick on “Restart”. This will restart your computer and automatically send you to the BIOS or UEFI settings\n\nNow this depends on your specific machine, but under some field called “Security”, you should find a sub-field called “Virtualization”. Inside this sub-field you should Enable all options\nSave and exit the BIOS or UEFI. IMPORTANT: you need to SAVE before exiting, otherwise you will need to redo the steps above\nTo check that virtualization is enabled, go to the Task Manager, to the Tab TODO\n\nEnable ‘wsl version 2’. Open PowerShell as Administrator, and then:\ndism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart\n\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n\n\nIf something goes wrong, follow the instructions given in PowerShell\nTo check if all of this worked, do wsl --version in Powershell",

If not, you have first to fix the error in HTML generation. See Section 31.6.\nThen generate a LaTeX file for the article. Section 31.2.2\n\n\nIf Pandoc generates HTML and LaTeX with no crash, then the error happens at the LaTeX stage.\nTypical causes for a LaTeX-stage error are:\n\nTypos in a math formulas.\nAn author’s LaTeX uses some packages or defined commands. These need to be provided to the article as header-includes. (Though sometimes you need to tell the author to simplify their LaTeX first!)\nRaw LaTeX code, either from the author or from you (e.g. added to handle fine-grained spacing) doesn’t work correctly\nAn author’s LaTeX code doesn’t interact well with our template.\nthere’s a bug in our filters or our template\n\n\nTo make progress you should look for the LaTeX error message. It’s displayed in the output when Pandoc fails to produce a PDF. It is on a line that starts with !, such as:\n! Undefined control sequence.\nl.512 \\llbracket\n          \n[1{/usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]\n(./smith_j.aux))\n(see the transcript file for additional information)\n... \n(more text)\n...\n\nOr:\n! LaTeX Error: File `image.png' not found.\n\nSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.\nType  H &lt;return&gt;  for immediate help.\n ...                                              \n                                                  \nl.618 \\includegraphics{image.png}\n                        \n[1{/usr/local/texlive/2023/texmf-var/fonts/map/pdftex/updmap/pdftex.map}]\n(./test.aux))\n... \n(more text)\n...\n\nNote that you can get the log as a text file in two ways:\n\nRun the command to generate the pdf but add 2&gt; out.log at the end, e.g. make off1pdf 2&gt; out.log. This will save the log as out.log.\nRun the LaTeX engine on the LaTeX file itself. Make sure you’ve generated a LaTeX file (.tex) and that you have a terminal localed in that folder. Run:\nlualatex --interaction=nonstopmode smith_j-2020.tex 2&gt; out.log\nadapting to your LaTeX file name. If you omit --interaction=nonstopmode the engine will instead stop at any error encountered and ask you what to do; you can enter “x” for exiting. (You can also enter “i” for ignoring the error, but typically that generates further errors down the line, and anyway all LaTeX errors have to be fixed before final output.)\nIf you run the LaTeX engine you’ll get a few ‘artefact’ files: &lt;article-name&gt;.log , .synctex, .aux. You can later erase them; try the command latexmk -C &lt;article-name&gt; (assumes you have latexmk in your LaTeX installation), otherwise erase them but remember to keep your source file .md and any .bib files!\n\n\nThe file out.log is a plain text file, you can open it for inspection in any simple editor and you can send it by email for help.\nEven if you don’t know LaTeX, you can glean some pointers form the LaTeX error message.\n\nThe line number (e.g. l. 618) is the line number in the LaTeX file, not in your source markdown file. Generate the LaTeX output (if it’s not already done) and go to that line in it: you’ll probably be able to figure out which part of the article is generating the error. Note however that it’s not a sure shot: LaTeX error at a line are sometimes due to issues much earlier in the document.\nError messages are often followed by a line split in two, as in:\n! Undefined control sequence.\nl.618 $\\binom{n}{k} = \\fract\n                        {n!}{k!(n-k)!}$\nThis means LaTeX crashed just before the split. Here the split occurs between \\fract and {n!}, so LaTeX crashed at \\fract. Often that is where the error is: the correct command for fractions is \\frac not \\fract. Again, it’s not a sure shot: LaTeX error at a line are sometimes due to issues much earlier in the document.\n\n\nIf that doesn’t help solving the issue, you can still try the time-consuming method below. Otherwise get help from somebody who’s more familiar with LaTeX or the journal’s template coder. Tell them what article generated the error, and copy-paste or attach the error log (or at least the part where the error message is).\nA last resort. More time-consuming but guaranteed result. Isolate the error. Make a copy of your file and trim it down until you can generate a PDF, as follows:\n\nDisconnect the bibliography file. In the metadata block, put a # in front of the bibliography line:\n# bibliography = smith-paper-references.bib\nThis deactivates the line. Try producing a PDF; if you don’t get the error, you know that the source is something in your bibliography file. Otherwise continue.\nIsolate the error by halves. Remove the second half of the document. Try producing a PDF. If you get an error, you know the problem is in the first half; divide it in two, repeat. When you get to the point where you don’t get an error (at a given point), start re-adding parts of the text one by one, until you identify what addition generates the error.\nIn that process you may get “warnings” you didn’t get before, e.g. because you’ve cut out the footnotes associated with a paragraph. Don’t worry about them, they’ll disappear once the relevant bits are re-added.",

    "text": "31.7 A brief guide on Pandoc’s PDF output logs\nWhen asking pandoc to produce a PDF you can produce an output log (see the sections on generating outputs to see how to do this with RStudio or the terminal).\nThe file begins with [INFO] messages about Pandoc’s source to LaTeX conversion. Typically this is just information about the `filters’ that Pandoc runs, e.g.:\n[INFO] Running filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua\n[INFO] Completed filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua in 70 ms\n\nThen, [makePDF] messages about the commands Pandoc executes to launch a LaTeX engine that converts the LaTeX to PDF. The “Command line” one tells you which LaTeX engine is used, here lualatex:\n[makePDF] Command line:\nlualatex \"-halt-on-error\" \"-interaction\" \"nonstopmode\" \"-output-directory\" \"&lt;TEMPDIR&gt;\" \"&lt;TEMPDIR&gt;/input.tex\"\n\nThe “Source” message copies the entire LaTeX file that Pandoc sends to the LaTeX engine. It can be useful for a quick look, but it’s more convenient to generate that LaTeX file separately (see how above). When you have LaTeX error messages that give a line number, that is the line number in the LaTeX file (hence it’s easier to find those when you open the separate LaTeX file in a text editor with numbered lines.)\n[makePDF] Source:\n% Options for packages loaded elsewhere\n\\PassOptionsToPackage{unicode}{hyperref}\n\\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url}\n\\PassOptionsToPackage{dvipsnames,svgnames*,x11names*}{xcolor}\n%\n... % more LaTeX code\n\nThe LaTeX source is usually very long (200-500 lines + at least the number of lines in your markdown source). To find the next section, you can search for [makePDF] Run in the file.\nThe “Run” messages ([makePDF] Run #1, [makePDF] Run #2…) give the LaTeX engine’s output messages. Generating PDFs from LaTeX typically requires several ‘runs’ of the LaTeX engine on the file: the first run generates various bits stored in an auxiliary file (e.g., which page a heading ends in, whether a citation is labelled Smith 2020 or Smith 2020a, …) and the second run uses them to finalize the PDF. Under each [makePDF] Run # you get the full LaTeX Log of the LaTeX engine. This is where you’ll find information, warnings and errors concerning PDF generation. For instance:\n[makePDF] Run #1\nThis is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.13.0 (TeX Live 2021) \n restricted system commands enabled.\n\n(/private/var/folders/j2/zp5ggjhx12xccgy5_wx32tfw0000gp/T/tex2pdf.-12ef5244637e\ndfd8/input.tex\nLaTeX2e &lt;2020-10-01&gt; patch level 4\n L3 programming layer &lt;2021-02-18&gt;\n(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/koma-script/scrbook.cls\nDocument Class: scrbook 2021/03/17 v3.33 KOMA-Script document class (book)\n(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/koma-script/scrkbase.sty\n...\n(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/amsfonts.sty))\n(/usr/local/texlive/2021/texmf-dist/tex/latex/stmaryrd/Ustmry.fd)\nLaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `U/stmry/m/n' in size &lt;5.5&gt; not available\n(Font)              size &lt;5&gt; substituted on input line 70.\n\n...\n...\n\nUnderfull \\hbox (badness 2469) in paragraph at lines 559--574\n[]\\TU/STIXTwoText(0)/m/n/10 I will also adopt the or-tho-dox ap-proach to meta-\nontology, \\TU/STIXTwoText(0)/m/it/10 neo-\n\nUnderfull \\hbox (badness 1158) in paragraph at lines 559--574\n\\TU/STIXTwoText(0)/m/it/10 Quineanism\\TU/STIXTwoText(0)/m/n/10 .

Here the package Ustmaryrd (a font collection) issues a warning that it’s using a 5pt characters in the absence of 5.5pt characters. input line 70 refers to the line in the LaTeX file.\npages generated: [1] [2] [3] [4] ... indicate that the corresponding page is “shipped out” (generated and saved into the PDF). This means we have no error or warning at pages 1 to 4, yay!\nUnderfull and overfull \\hbox warnings, e.g. Underfull \\hbox (badness 2469). These indicate that LaTeX has generated a less-than-ideal horizontal line: an horizontal line with a bit too much, or not enough, text. Typically nothing to worry about: the text is just slightly more or less spaced than usual. However, very bad cases of overfull can be a table or long equation or image or some unbreakable large item that sticks out of your text block. The easiest is to check for them visually in the PDF output, but if you are after perfection you can check all the ones mentioned in the log. To know which pages they’re on, look for [n] page shipout indicators before and after the overfull message.\nIf compilation runs without error, the end messages. These includes the warning if a LaTeX rerun is needed (LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may   have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.), which you don’t need to worry about because Pandoc takes care of this, and statistics about the output (Output written on input.pdf (18 pages, 113569 bytes).)\n\n\nIf the PDF building from LaTeX has failed, you will see LaTeX error messages. For instance:\n! Missing $ inserted.\n&lt;inserted text&gt; \n                $\nl.6 \n    \n!  ==&gt; Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!\nTranscript written on dummy.log.\n\nThe error message starts with !, followed by a (more or less useful) description of the message, and an excerpt of the LaTeX code before and after the error occurred, and the line the engine was processing when the error occurred. Here the error was a missing $: in LaTeX $ is used to surround mathematical formulas, and each ‘opening’ dollar sign must be matched with a ‘closing’ one. The error was produced as the engine was processing line 6.\nImportant. The line at which the error occurred is not necessarily the line where the mistake is. For instance, with matching $ the error is at the point where the engine realizes that the number of $ isn’t matched. But typically the mistake was earlier on, where a $ sign should have been.\nTo diagnose and solve LaTeX error you need knwoledge and experience of LaTeX, which is beyond the scope of this guide. It often helps to make an internet search on the error message text.",

(Learn how to navigate folders in the command line, and go where your markdown file is.)\nthat folder is located three folders down from the workhouse’s base folder (the folder where the processing, resources folders are located). So your markdown file can be in:\nprocessing/2020-01-special-issue/01-michels\nfinished/2020-02-issue/01-elzein\n…\n\n\nThe file resources/defaults.yaml contains our default settings for pandoc, and they also assume that your file is three folder down from the base. This is why we preface resources/defaults with ../../../ in our pandoc command (to indicate that the file is three folder up from where you are when you run pandoc).\nIf you want to run pandoc with our settings on a file that’s located elsewhere, you can use the full command.

    "text": "How much of the author’s original stylistic choices should a copyeditor keep? Here are some guiding principles.\nSemantics first!. In general, only keep meaningful features. We typeset content first, not look. We preserve emphasis, but we don’t preserve an author’s choice of a particular emphasis style (italics vs small caps vs bold). We preserve numbered list, but we don’t preserve an author’s choice of specific numbering style (arab numbers, roman numbers, letters). If authors object, they need to explain why their idiosyncratic notation choices are needed (maybe in the paper itself, at least to us).\nEfficiency. The semantics first principle is tempered by efficiency considerations. Changing an author’s square brackets to round ones is easy. Changing their choice of LaTeX commands can be error-prone. Redoing their figures to use the journal’s font can be time-consuming. If an author’s cohice is too costly for us to change and doesn’t heart readability and comprehension, we let it pass.\nEgos. The principle is also tempered by social considerations. If adopting our style proves particulary difficult with an author, causing back-and-forth that may delay publication, we can cave in. Their paper, their problem, after all.\nBibliography. Dialectica’s policy with respect to the bibliography has been to enforce our preferences irrespective of efficiency or author’s egos. For instance, we require that they cite from originals rather than reprints (leading to back and forth as they source and check the original), that they cite the latest edition of a book, or that they provide more specific page ranges.",

In PDF output you get a LaTeX warning message such as:\nThere are three ways to solve this.\nMethods 1 and 2 are easy and should be tried first.\nRequires: Pandokoma template.\nConsider the character ‘à’, for instance. A LaTeX warning message would give its Unicode number in hexadecimal format: 00E0. (Hexadecimal means that A,B, … F are used in addition to digits 0…9. Unicode numbers are typically written U+xxx, i.e. U+00E0.) Search for “Unicode 00E0” online, and go to one of the websites that have a detailed page on each Unicode character. Look for a “decomposition mapping” such as:\nThis shows that the Unicode character can be created by combining the a character with the character number 0300. 0300 is a special modifier or combining character, who combines with the preceding character. It should not be confused with the self-standing character ` (code 0060) that does not combine with the previous character.\nIn the template folder, open settings/common-latex.yaml. Search for the newunicodechar section:\nAdd an entry for your character. The char value should be the missing character itself (copy/paste it). The command value is the combination used to recreate it:\nThe combination should be entered in the same order as you found on the reference webpage: here we have a first then ```. (In Unicode combinations, the added diacritics come after the letter.)\nThe combining characters can be entered either directly (here, the a) or with \\symbol{\"...} command, where ‘…’ is the hexadecimal Unicode number (here, the modifier ` is entered with \\symbol{\"0300}.) So the above is equivalent to:\nbecause the Unicode number of a is 0061. You would normally enter modifier Unicode characters by number because they do not display well in text editors.",

\\char. For omicron (Unicode decimal 959, hexadecimal OxO3BF):\n\\symbol{\"03BF}\n\\symbol{959}\n\\char\"03BF\n\\char959\n\nTo combine a character with a diacritic use the character directly followed by the combining diacritic. For instance, you can create Greek small omicron with psili (Unicode U+1F40) by combining Greek small omicron (ο, U+03BF) with the combining Greek koronis (U+0343). Any of these work:\nο\\symbol{\"0343}\nο\\char\"0343\n\\char\"03BF\\char\"0343\n\\symbol{\"03BF}\\char\"0343\n\\symbol{\"03BF}\\symbol{\"0343}\n\\char\"03BF\\symbol{\"0343}\n\nThe combining Greek Koronis is usually the same as the combining comma above (U+0313), so you could use that instead.",

Here’s all you need to know about it; you can learn it in 20 minutes or less.\nA terminal, aka shell or command line is a tool for text-based interaction with a computer, as opposed to graphical user interfaces (“GUI”, mouse, trackpad or touch-based). There are some things you can only do with a terminal (e.g. running Pandoc), and others that can be done very quickly if you know how to use a terminal. Using it is a throwback to the 80s and will make you feel like a hacker.\nYou can use a dedicated terminal application.

    "text": "A.3 Navigation\nYour terminal is always “at” or “in” some folder or other. We call it the “current folder” of the “present working directory”. On Windows’ CMD the folder you’re “in” is displayed at the beginning of the line:\nC:Users\\MyName&gt;\n\nOn Linux and MacOS you might only see the name of the folder you are in (myfolder), not the full path; and it might just be ~, which is a shorthand for your main user folder. You can run the pwd (“present working directory”) command to display its full name.\nWhere you are located matters to the execution of most commands. Suppose you run the command:\npandoc article.md -o article.pdf\n\nThis asks pandoc to convert the file article.md into article.pdf in the current folder. If you don’t run that command while being located in the folder where the file article.md is, you will get an error message telling you that there is no file of that name.\nSo basic terminal usage requires you to know which folder you are currently in, and how to change folder, and to refer to files in different folders. The commands you need are:\n\nList contents of current folder with ls (Linux/MacOS) or dir (Win).\ncd change directory. If your current folder contains a subfolder called MyFolder, you can get into it with cd MyFolder. You can use cd .. go “up” to the folder that contains yours. Several folders can be combined with the directory separator / (Linux MacOs) or \\ (Windows): cd MyFolder/article/example to go down three folders, cd ../.. to go up two.\n\n\nThat’s it! If you need more, you can learn in a few minutes using an online tutorial. Here are some, as of time of writing:\n\nLinux / MacOS: Command Line for Beginners. The Linux and MacOS terminals are essentially the same, so tutorials will work for both.\nMacOS: Navigating files and folders .\nWindows: How to use the Windows command line (cmd) Note that these instructions work with Powershell too.\n\n\nTry searching for “command line tutorial &lt;Win/Linux/MacOS” for more.",

    "text": "A.4 Life-saving tips\nIf you don’t use those tips you’ll find the command line frustrating. If you do use them you’ll probably get to like it.\n\nA.4.1 Don’t type file and folder names, use auto-completion\nIn the terminal you almost never need to type an entire file or folder name. Instead, type the first few letters and hit the “Tab” key one or two times.\n\nOn Linux/MacOS terminals, the first “Tab” hit will auto-complete if there’s only one way to complete. If there are several, nothing happens but a second “Tab” hit will list you the possible completions.\nOn Windows, the first “Tab” hit gives you one auto-complete possibility, hit again to see others.\n\n\nThis only applies to file and folder names. The terminal won’t guess which command you type (pand plus Tab won’t be completed to pandoc).\nAuto-completion is also a good way to avoid typos. If no completion shows up, you’ve probably mis-typed the beginning.\n\n\nA.4.2 File and folder names with spaces need quotation marks\nWhen you type file and folder names that contain spaces, you should enclose them in quotation marks (either single ' or double \"):\npandoc -s \"my article 2022.md\" -o \"output april 24th.pdf\"\n\nOn Linux and MacOS if you use auto-completion on Linux or MacOS, you’ll notice that the system places \\ before the spaces. This is called “escaping” the spaces and works too, but only in those systems:\npandoc -s my\\ article\\ 2022.md -o output\\ april\\ 24th.pdf \n\nOn Windows, \\ is used to separate folders, so you can’t use it. You have to use quotes.\nYou’re better off without spaces in your file and folder names, to be honest. Linux typically uses “kebab case”, skewering words with dashes: my-article-april-24th.pdf. “Snake case” with slithering underscores is good too: my_article_april_24th.pdf.\n\n\nA.4.3 Don’t retype commands, use up arrow\nExample: run the command ls (or dir on Win). Then, at the new prompt, type the Up arrow on your keyboard: you’ll see ls (or dir) displayed again, and you only need to type “Enter” to run it again.\nType the arrow several times to see the commands you’ve entered before last, before before last and so on.\n\n\nA.4.4 Move the cursor with quick arrows\nYou’ll find that in the terminal you can’t reposition the cursor with a mouse click. Instead, you have to move it with the left and right arrows. This can be frustratingly slow. The solution is to use quick arrows that move ‘word’ per ‘word’ (where a ‘word’ is any chunk of text separated by spaces):\n\nLinux: Alt + Left/Right arrow\nMacOS: option + Left/Right arrow\nWin: Ctrl + Left/Right arrow\n\n\nFor instance, if you typed a long command like this and got an error. You realize you need to replace “procesing” with “processing”:\npandoc -s procesing/new/articles/2020/issue-02/02-article.md --defaults mydefaultsfile.md -t outputs/recent/articles/2020/issue-02/02.article.pdf \n\n(See, you should have used auto-completion to avoid the typo!) So you hit the Up arrow, the command shows again. If you hit the Left arrow, you’ll need to press the key 137 times to get to the typo. You can keep it pressed instead, but that’s still very slow. If you use Alt/Option/Ctrl + Left arrow, you’re there in 5 times. Get used to it!\n\n\nA.4.5 Ctrl + C if a command hangs\nIf you run a command and it hangs, or takes too much time to run, you can (normally) interrupt it by hitting Ctrl + C (on all systems, MacOS included).",
