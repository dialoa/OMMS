It is focused on a markdown-based publishing process. Its aims at enabling open access publishers, copyeditors and authors to produce modern publications with high-quality typesetting. 1.1 Background This manual was created to help the transition to open access of Dialectica, an international journal in philosophy. 1.2 How to edit this book The book is written in markdown. It usesbookdown, an extension of RStudio, to produce the book from markdown files. The files to generate the book are at: dialectica-workhouse/guide 1.2.1 Two methods for editing You can edit the book in two ways: with RStudio, or with a simple text editor. The first method is comfortable for writing large parts, the second best suited to small changes. Only the first allows you to regenerate the book with your updates. 1.2.1.1 Editing with RStudio Install RStudio, if you don’t have it already. Select Tools &gt; Install packages…, enter bookdown, install. Go to dialectica-workhouse/guide. Open the project file dialectica-guide.Rproj. You’ll see the chapter files and you can edit them. To regenerate the book with your changes, make sure you have one of the chapters open in the Rstudio editor. Go to the menu “Build” and click either “Build all” or “Install and restart” (or use the shortcut, Shift Cmd B on MacOS or Shift Ctrl B on Windows).1 1.2.1.2 Edit with a text editor You can edit and add .Rmd files with any editor you use for markdown (Notepad, Emacs, Atom, Sublime, RStudio, etc.). Without RStudio and its bookdown add-on you can’t generate the book. 1.2.2 Tips for editing 1.2.2.1 Basic tips The files have the extension .Rmd. You can edit them like ordinary markdown files.2 Avoid naming footnotes [^1], [^2] as these are likely to be duplicates across the book. Rather use some short chapter id or custom name, [^bib-1] or [^howtofixtables]. The editor in RStudio has a “content outline” button at the top right (next to the visual mode button). Use it to navigate the markdown files. 1.2.2.2 Structure Chapters are level 1 heading, coded # or with a ==== underline in markdown. Files named 01 should start with a chapter heading. The chapters are organized into parts: publishing, copyediting. These are indicated at the beginning of a chapter with the code: # (PART) Publishing {-} 1.2.2.3 New files, filenames Files are included in the book in numerical order: 01, 02, 021, 022, 03, … etc. Note that 021 is printed between 02 and 03. This makes it easy to create sub-parts. The numbers don’t need to, and typically won’t correspond to chapter numbers in the generated output. We can leave gaps between numbers to easily interleave new chapters. Create new files with a text editor or by saving an old one under a new names. Files must have the .Rmd extension or they won’t be printed. File naming conventions 01, 02 are used for files that start a chapter. 021, 022 are used for subparts of a chpater. the book is divided into parts: authoring (aut), copyediting (cop), publishing (pub). We use these at the beginning of file names: 01-pub-why-markdown.Rmd. Authoring has numbers 00 to 09, copyediting 10 to 29, publishing 30 to 49. The preface is in index.Rmd. Do not use the “Knit” button in the editor, it won’t update the entire book.↩︎ The only difference is that they allow more things which aren’t relevant for this documentation, namely entering R code to generate graphs from statistical data.↩︎ "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction This part gives instructions for authors.

"],["preliminaries.html", "Chapter 5 Preliminaries 5.1 What you need 5.2 Working folder", " Chapter 5 Preliminaries This chapter explains what you need to set up a markdown production chain. 5.1 What you need 5.1.1 Skills Use a text editor (RStudio will do). Optionally, how to use the command line interface.3 The very basics are enough: navigate to a directory, run a command. 5.1.2 Software All the software needed is free. Pandoc (converts tex files to Markdown files). Installations instructions here. MacOS users: optionally, install using homebrew, a command-line tool that can be used to install almost anything, esp. open-source tools (e.g. LaTeX), and more importantly to keep them all updated. RStudio (visual Markdown editor where the papers will be edited). Download RStudio 1.4 beta’s latest version. a LaTeX installation. RStudio installs one if needed, or you may already have one installed if you use LaTeX already. To check whether you have it installed, after you’ve installed pandoc you can run pandoc \\--version on the command line and it will tell you whether TeX is installed. 5.2 Working folder Create a working folder for your journal. This may be shared between copyeditors if you’re a team. Suggested folder structure: archive/ vol-12/ issue-01/ smith-et-al/ singh/ originals vol-13/ issue-02/ doe/ fernandez/ issue-03 wang-li/ processing vol-13/ issue-02/ doe/ fernandez/ issue-03 wang-li/ finished vol-12/ issue-01/ smith-et-al/ singh/ resources Each article has its own folder, e.g. vol-13/issue-02/doe. These structures folders are moved or copied across different top folders: originals contains the author’s submitted files. processing the files you’re currently copyediting. If collaborating, treat each article folder here as the workspace of that article’s copyeditor: they can use it as they see fit, creating multiple versions, running tests and so on. finished contains the copyeditor’s finished products. archive can be used to archive the processing files, if needed. resources stores templates, configuration files, fonts, etc. “Command line interface”, aka CLI, is the “command prompt” on Windows, “terminal” on MacOs and”shell” in Linux. Plenty of brief tutorials can be found online.↩︎ "],["generate-house-style-outputs.html", "Chapter 6 Generate house style outputs 6.1 Pre-requistes 6.2 Setup", " Chapter 6 Generate house style outputs Most of the instructions in this section are specific to the setup of folders of Dialectica’s working team. 6.1 Pre-requistes You need the following (2 to 5 Gb disk space): (Optional but recommended) RStudio, a markdown editor with a visual mode, a built-in terminal, and the ability to run scripts that generate HTML / PDF versions of your manuscript. ~900Mb Pandoc version 2.19+. ~50Mb A LaTeX distribution. (LaTeX is called a ‘distribution’ or ‘installation’ because it’s not a single program but a large collection of programs and ‘packages’ that work together to generate PDFs.) ~1.5Gb LaTeX is not a single software but a large collection of programs, or “packages”, that work together to generate PDFs. This is why we call it an “installation” or “distribution.) The STIX Two and Libertinus (incl. Libertinus Display) fonts, available in dialectica-workhouse/resources/fonts. If you don’t install them, the PDFs will still be generated but with some default fonts. negligible On MacOS, Apple’s Command line tools for Xcode. ~2.5Gb On Windows: the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is needed for generating outputs within RStudio and with the make command. You can do without it if you’re only using pandoc commands on the terminal. ~1Gb latexmk, a command-line program we use to generate PDFs. It is part of LaTeX but not always installed by default. ~100Mb, if you need to install Perl Are Pandoc / LaTeX / latexmk installed, and which version?. To know whether these are installed, open a terminal (or use the ‘Terminal’ tab within RStudio) and enter the following commands. See “Using the terminal” below on how to do this. For Pandoc: pandoc -v For LaTeX: pdflatex -version If you get error messages, they are not installed. If you get version numbers, they are installed. This works on all systems. 6.2 Setup (Optional) If you’re familiar with the command line, you can install faster with a package manager: Chocolatey on Windows, Homebrew on MacOS, your distribution’s package manager on Linux. Advantage: upgrade all your installed software with a single command, e.g. choco upgrade. Windows users: don’t forget that Chocolatey should not be run in the basic “CMD” terminal but the “Windows Powershell (x86)”, run with administrator priviledges. Search it in the start menu, right-click and chose “Run as administrator”. 6.2.1 Common to all platforms 6.2.1.1 Pandoc Download and install from Pandoc’s website. Or, command line users: run brew install pandoc (Homebrew), choco install pandoc (Chocolatey) in a terminal. 6.2.1.2 LaTeX Use either MikTeX or TexLive) (whose Mac version is called MacTeX). I recommend MikTeX. For MikTeX: download the installer, launch it. Select “install only for this user”, and for installing packages on the fly, select “Ask me first”. For TexLive, non-Mac: download the network installer, launch it. When/if offered the choice, choose to install “all” or “everything”. This can take ~30 minutes depending on download speed. For TexLive, Mac users: download the installer. MikTeX’s advantage is that it downloads any needed packages on the fly, so it’s quicker to install and will get whatever you need. So be aware that if you use MikTeX, you first PDFs generation will open a window asking you to confirm the download of packages and take a long time as MikTeX download missing pages. Don’t worry, subsequent PDF generations are much faster. Command-line users: Homebrew: brew install --cask mactex. Cannot install MikTeX (as of Jan 2023). MikTeX doesn’t need brew anyway, it self-updates. Chocolatey: choco install miktex or choco install texlive --params \"'/scheme:full'\". Linux: depends on package managers, e.g. sudo apt-get install miktex or sudo apt-get install texlive-full. However, you might need to add ‘Software sources’ to do this: see e.g. the MikTeX webpage. 6.2.1.3 Fonts Dialectica’s fonts are located in dialectica-workhouse\\resources\\fonts. Open a file browser and navigate to the folder of a desired font (for Stix Two, STIX Two fonts\\OTF). Select all the files and, depending on system: To install fonts, open the Finder and navigate to the folder where the fonts are located (dialectica-workhouse/resources/fonts). Open the folder of the desired font (for Stix Two, STIX Two fonts/OTF). Double-click each file there (regular, italic, bold, …), and in the windows that appear, select “Install font”. You can check that the fonts are installed by opening the Font Book (in the Applications folder, or Cmd + Space and search for Font Book) and selecting the User tab. (Windows) right-click and select “Install fonts”, (Mac) Enter or right-click &gt; Open. Select “Install font” in the windows that open. You can check that they are installed by opening the Font Book app. (Linux) depends on distribution. On Ubuntu, for instance, double-click on the font files opens a font viewer with the option to install. If that doesn’t work on your distribution, try an online search. 6.2.1.4 RStudio (optional) See RStudio’s download page for installation instructions. Command line users also install it with package managers (e.g. brew install --cask rstudio). When installed, note that RStudio includes: a file browser on the left a terminal at the bottom, under the ‘Terminal’ tab. (The ‘Console’ is something else). when editing markdown files, the Source and Visual tabs at the top left of the editor. These allows you to edit files in visual mode rather than markdown. Limitation: the visual mode can’t be used if the manuscript contains “numbered examples lists”. when editing markdown files, an ‘Outline’ panel on the right side of the editor. Useful to navigate a manuscript. RStudio might be intimidating at first: it’s not a word processor but a “development environment” for the statistics programming language R. It’s not just used to write programs, however, but also write documents that embed compuations: a webpage with a graph that is daily updated, or a scientific article that includes algorithms and data to reproduce its results. So don’t worry: you will mostly be using its markdown editor here, which is powerful but simple. Some of the development features are handy too, like the file browser and the ability to run scripts to generate our outputs. 6.2.2 Windows-specific 6.2.2.1 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) This provides a Linux system (terminal-only) in Windows. It’s needed to generate outputs within RStudio and with make commands. It’s not needed to generate outputs by running pandoc on the command line. Note that you will need a computer restart during the installation. You will also need to set a username and password (to run Linux admin tasks, e.g.  installing programs). The username and password need not be those you use for Windows, but remember them! Command line users: wsl --install (works on a CMD terminal or a Powershell) is supposed to do Steps 1-3 all at once, but I found I had to do Step 2 below anyway, and you may need to do wsl --install -d ubuntu in addition instead of Step 1. Other users: Step 1. Open the Microsoft Store and install Ubuntu. There are several versions, you can take the one called “Ubuntu” or the highest-numbered with “LTS” (long term service) in its name. Step 2. Go to Control Panel (search or type in the start menu bar) &gt; Programs &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off. In the list find Windows Subsystem for Linux and tick it. After the change is applied you will be asked to restart the computer. Step 3. After the computer has restarted, open Ubuntu (search or type in the start menu bar). A terminal is opened with an installation message, and after a few minutes, a prompt to create a username and then a password. (You’ll need to type the password blind: it’s not displayed for security reasons.) If you get an error message instead, see ‘Troubleshooting WSL’ below. Step 4. Install the make program by typing sudo apt install make then Enter. You will be prompted for your password. This should look like this: &lt;username&gt;@MACHINENAME:~$ sudo apt install make [sudo] password for &lt;username&gt;: Reading package lists... Done Building dependcy tree... Done (... more install messages ...) The installation is done when you get your user prompt again: &lt;username&gt;@MACHINENAME:~$ You can close the window. You’re done. Your computer can now run Linux command-line programs, in particular the make program that we use to simplify the generation of outputs. Troubleshooting. At step 3 you may see the following instead: Installing, this may take a few minutes... WslRegisterDistribution failed with error: 0x800719e The Windows Subsystem for Linux optional component is not enabled. Please enable it and try again. See https://aka.mx/wslinstall for details. Press any key to continue... If so try again step 1. More help on installing WSL: Microsoft WSL instructions or the Ubuntu WSL instructions. There’s also a visual How-To Geek guide. 6.2.2.2 Latexmk Latexmk is needed to generate PDFs within RStudio and with make commands. It’s not needed to generate PDFs by running pandoc on the command line. First check whether it’s already installed. It is part of LaTeX and your distribution may already include it. Open a terminal (or use the one within RStudio) and enter latexmk -v. If it is installed, you will get a version number like so: $ latexmk -v Latexmk, John Collins, 17 Mar. 2022. Version 4.77 If you get an error message along the lines of ‘command/binary not found’ or “MikTeX cannot install latexmk: Perl required”, you need to install it. MikTeX installation. Follow these steps: Install Perl. Download on Perl’s webpage. You can choose the open-source version (Strawberry). Command line users: with Chocolatey, choco install strawberryperl. Enter latexmk -v in a terminal. This will prompt MikTeX to dowload and install Latexmk automatically. Note: previously open RStudio windows and terminals won’t recognize latexmk yet. Close and reopen before using it. TexLive installation. Try this. If it doesn’t work, you may have to install Perl first (see above). Open a Powershell in Administrator mode: search “Powershell” in the start menu, look for “Windows PowerShell (x86)”, right-click and choose “Run as administrator”. Run the following command (i.e. type it and press Enter): tlmgr install latexmk You should get a message telling you whether the installation is successful or not. If in doubt, run latexmk -v to check. If you get an error message, you could try installing Perl first (see MikTeX instructions above) and trying this command again. 6.2.3 MacOS-specific To install Apple’s Command Line Tools. This is necessary even if you’re not going to use the command line your self: it installs the software needed to run the Makefile file. Open the Terminal (in Applications &gt; Utilities). Type the following and hit Enter: xcode-select --install This will download and install the software from Apple (~100Mb, a few minutes). When that is done close the Terminal window. If you get an error “command line tools already installed”, the software is already installed. You can close the window and proceed. "],["single-article-with-rstudio.html", "Chapter 7 Single article with RStudio", " Chapter 7 Single article with RStudio Create a RStudio project for the article you are working on. This is explained in the next chapter of the guide. Copy the script and master files in your article’s project folder. The files needed are: Linux / MacOS: master.md, Makefile. Windows: master.md, make.bat Dialectica-specific. These can be found in the workhouse folder at template/&lt;x.x&gt;/EXTRA/copyeditor-scripts, where x.x is the latest version of the template (e.g. 1.1). It’s good to copy all in case someone working on a different system than yours needs to regenerate your article’s output. These are very tiny files. Optional: on Linux/MacOS, you can also copy generatemakefile.sh to your article folder. Running it (in that folder) with sh generatemakefile.sh will update the Makefile and make.bat from EXTRAS. Edit the master file(s) to indicate your source file name. Open master.md. Find the lines: imports: - source.md Replace source.md with the name of your article’s markdown file, save. In RStudio, open your article’s project and go to the menu Build &gt; Configure Build Tools. Enter the following choices: Project build tools: “Makefile” Makefile directory: leave as default (Project Root). Additional argument: one of the following: leave empty to generate html. pdf to generate only PDFs, final style. (Windows: see below.) pdf proof=true to generate a PDF in proof style. (Windows, see below.) all to generate both html and a final-style pdf. all proof=true to generate both and a proof-style pdf. tex or latex to generate LaTeX files (add proof=true for proof style). html for html only, equivalent to empty. When starting copyediting, html is best because (1) it’s much faster than PDF and (2) PDF generation can break down with no output at all. HTML almost always produce an output. It only breaks down if your document’s metadata is ill-formed or if there’s a bug in one of our “filters” that format the outputs. Once that is done, you can generate outputs in one click. in Rstudio you either go to menu -&gt; build -&gt; build all, or use the shortcut shift-cmd-B (on Windows shift-ctrl-B). It creates an html and pdf in the article folder, or whatever you “Additional arguments” option generates. Note: the script will generate outputs for all the .md files in the folder. This should be harmless, but can take time. If you want one markdown file to be skipped, you have to move it in a subfolder or change its extension to .mkd for instance. PDFs on Windows. On Windows, you need to the latexmk program installed. If you’re lucky, it came with your LaTeX distribution. See “Install latexmk on Windows’ above. Troubleshooting: On MacOS, you get and alert “Cannot run pandoc-crossref because it is not from a trusted developper”. Solution: close the alert (don’t chose “Move to Bin”!). In Finder, go to the folder dialectica-workhouse/resources/filters. Cmd-click the file pandoc-crossref (not pandoc-crossref.exe), and chose “Open”. You will get the same alert but this time with the option to Open. Select it, nothing should happen but after that you should be able to build the outputs in RStudio. If you get a pdf file with a cover but no title or article content, you probably forgot to update the filename in master.md or master-win.md with your markdown source file’s name. If it doesn’t create an html, your pandoc is not updated. Ask us for help if needed. If you get an error message about Stix TWO, you haven’t installed the font in your computer. See above. If you get an error message “Error: PDF output not produced”, Pandoc is probably able to generate html and LaTeX output (you can test with the options above), but the conversion from LaTeX to PDF (done by a LaTeX engine such as pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex) fails. In those cases it’s useful to use the debug option generated above. You will get a .log file that gives you more detail about the error. The file can be opened in RStudio and its structure is explained a bit in the Troubleshooting section below. "],["using-the-terminal-optional-feel-free-to-skip.html", "Chapter 8 Using the terminal (optional, feel free to skip)", " Chapter 8 Using the terminal (optional, feel free to skip) Some instructions below refer to the “Terminal”. By this we mean the command line interface (CLI), a.k.a. Terminal in MacOS, Command Prompt or PowerShell in Windows, Terminal or Shell in Linux. In the RStudio instructions, they are optional (for information only), so you don’t need to use the command line. But the basics are simple: On Win, enter “PowerShell” or “cmd” in the search bar next to the start menu. Alternatively, open start menu look for Windows Accessories &gt; PowerShell or Windows Accessories &gt; Command Prompt or Windows Accessories &gt; Command Prompt. On MacOS, hit Cmd + Space to open Spotlight search and search for Terminal, or look for Utilities &gt; Terminal in your applications folder. On Linux, you probably already know how to do this. In Ubuntu, for instance, hit Ctrl+Alt+t, or search for ‘terminal’ in the Dash menu (top left corner). When you open the terminal a line shows up waiting for your input, e.g.: user@my-pc-laptop ~ % or C:Users\\MyName&gt; “Entering” or “running” or “executing” a “command” on the terminal means typing some text and press the “Enter” key. (Or copying / pasting it: note that in some terminals the usual copying / pasting shortcuts don’t work and you need instead to right-click and chose “Paste”). For instance, type the following and press enter: pandoc --version If you get an error message, this means that pandoc is not installed (not somewhere your system finds it, at any rate). If you get instead something like: pandoc 2.17.1.1 Compiled with pandoc-types 1.22.1, texmath 0.12.4, skylighting 0.12.2, citeproc 0.6.0.1, ipynb 0.2 Then you have just “run” or “executed” the command “pandoc” with the option “--version”; the programm pandoc has replied by printing out its version number. For most terminal tasks you also need to be able to change folders (aka “directories”) and list the files contained in a folder. When you open the terminal you are located “in” or “at” a given location in your system’s file - normally, your starting location is your user’s main folder. On Windows the full path of the folder you are “in” is displayed at the beginning of the line: C:\\Users\\MyUserName&gt; On Linux and MacOS you might only see the name of the folder you are in (MyUserName), not the full path; and it might just be ~, which is a shorthand for your home user folder. Now where you are located matters to the execution of most commands. For instance, if you entered: pandoc article.md -o article.pdf This asks pandoc to convert the file article.md into article.pdf in the current folder. If you don’t run that command while being located in the folder where article.md is, you will get an error message telling you that there is no file article.md. So basic terminal usage requires you to know which folder you are currently in, and how to change folder, and to refer to files in different folders. You can learn this in a few minutes using some tutorial like: MacOS: see first navigating files and folders and then see this list of terminal commands. Windows: see the section on “working with files and directories” in this tutorial. Linux: see this tutorial. Note the Linux and MacOS terminals are pretty much the same, so tutorials for one will work for another.

Careful not to confuse copyeditor-scripts and copyeditor-scripts-issue: you want the latter. You might want to copy generatemakefile.sh too: this is a script to generate a custom Makefile for the issue (see below). Edit the master file. Open master.md and check its imports field. This should specify the list of source files for the issue, in the order desired. For instance: imports: - 01-michels/michels.md - 02-benyami/benyami.md - 03-dicher/dicher.md - 04-kim/kim.md - 05-reinmuth/reinmuth.md - 06-sagi/sagi.md - 07-cook/cook.md - 08-djordjevic/djordjevic.md Use a make command to generate an issue or offprint output. Open a terminal and navigate to the issue folder. The following commands will generate issue outputs: make, or make pdf whole issue pdf. make tex or make latex issue LaTeX file. make book or make bookpdf (PDF) and make bootex (LaTeX) for the whole issue in book style (special issues). Check that the ISBN specified in master.md is correct. make off1 pdf of the first paper in imports, and similarly for make off2, make off3 etc. makeoff1htmlfor the first paper inimports` in HTML version make off1tex for the first paper in imports in LaTeX version. make offprints (PDF), make offprintstex (LaTeX), make offprintshtml (HTML) to generate all offrpints. make bare (PDF) and make baretex (LaTeX) empty issue (cover, backmatter) for design purposes. By default the issue output is name issue.pdf and offprint outputs are named offprint1.pdf, offprint2.pdf etc (and similarly for LaTeX outputs). If you want them to be named after the doi and source files names instead, generate a custom Makefile (see below). Generate a custom Makefile (optional). Open a terminal and navigate to the issue folder. If you have copied the generatemakefile.sh script in that folder, simply run the command: sh generatemakefile.sh This will generate a Makefile with the same commands (off1, off1tex) but whose offprint outputs will take the name of the respective sources (djordjevic.pdf, etc). The issue output will be named after the doi if one is specified, e.g. dial.v74.i1.pdf. This also gives you new commands to generate all the outputs of an issue: the issue and all its offprints, or all the offprints. make all make alltex make offprints make offprintstex These commands can be combined with proof=true.

When trying to produce a PDF, you get a message such as: Error producing PDF. ! Undefined control sequence. l.354 ... Meaning. Something in your markdown article or your bibliography file causes an error in the pdf engine. The second line is a short description of the kind of error the engine encounters. The third line tells you at which line number it occurs but not in your markdown document (explanations below). Explanation. pandoc produces PDFs in two steps: md -&gt; TeX (done by pandoc itself) and TeX -&gt; PDF (delegated to a TeX processor programme, pdflatex or xelatex). This message is for errors in the second step, in the pdflatex or xelatex programme. What to do to fix it depends on whether you’re familiar with TeX. Low tech fixes? If you’re not familiar with TeX, a few things to try: You should still be able produce other outputs than PDFs. If you’re not familiar with TeX, you should produce an HTML output, and see if you can spot a point where the manuscript goes wrong. You should produce a LaTeX log. (This can be done from RStudio or the command line, cf above.) The log file can be opened in a text editor (including RStudio). If you encountered a LaTeX error this typically appears towards the end of the log. But it’s very long and arcane. See the section on the log file below for some explanations. More time-consuming but guaranteed result. Isolate the error. Make a copy of your file and trim it down until you can generate a PDF, as follows: Disconnect the bibliography file. In the metadata block, put a # in front of the bibliography line: # bibliography = smith-paper-references.bib This deactivates the line. Try producing a PDF; if you don’t get the error, you know that the source is something in your bibliography file. Otherwise continue. Isolate the error by halves. Remove the second half of the document. Try producing a PDF. If you get an error, you know the problem is in the first half; divide it in two, repeat. When you get to the point where you don’t get an error (at a given point), start re-adding parts of the text one by one, until you identify what addition generates the error. In that process you may get “warnings” you didn’t get before, e.g. because you’ve cut out the footnotes associated with a paragraph. Don’t worry about them, they’ll disappear once the relevant bits are re-added. Hi-tech fixes. Output a .tex version of your document, OUTPUT.tex. Open it. * you can check the line indicated in the error message. Do you see a TeX mistake there? * run lualatex on the file. You can do so from a TeX editor such as TeXshop or simply from the command line: ``` lualatex OUTPUT.tex ``` This generates a bunch of auxiliary files, including a `OUTPUT.log` and terminates in the same error `pandoc` reported. Now open the `.log` file and scroll towards the end to read the error messages. * If that&#39;s not enough to show what&#39;s wrong with the original markdown file (or your pandoc template for LaTeX output), you can try and modify the LaTeX file until it compiles correctly. Good luck! 12.2 A brief guide on Pandoc’s PDF output logs When asking pandoc to produce a PDF you can produce an output log (see the sections on generating outputs to see how to do this with RStudio or the terminal). The file begins with [INFO] messages about Pandoc’s source to LaTeX conversion. Typically this is just information about the `filters’ that Pandoc runs, e.g.: [INFO] Running filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua [INFO] Completed filter ../../../resources/filters/abstract-to-meta.lua in 70 ms Then, [makePDF] messages about the commands Pandoc executes to launch a LaTeX engine that converts the LaTeX to PDF. The “Command line” one tells you which LaTeX engine is used, here lualatex: [makePDF] Command line: lualatex &quot;-halt-on-error&quot; &quot;-interaction&quot; &quot;nonstopmode&quot; &quot;-output-directory&quot; &quot;&lt;TEMPDIR&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;TEMPDIR&gt;/input.tex&quot; The “Source” message copies the entire LaTeX file that Pandoc sends to the LaTeX engine. It can be useful for a quick look, but it’s more convenient to generate that LaTeX file separately (see how above). When you have LaTeX error messages that give a line number, that is the line number in the LaTeX file (hence it’s easier to find those when you open the separate LaTeX file in a text editor with numbered lines.) [makePDF] Source: % Options for packages loaded elsewhere \\PassOptionsToPackage{unicode}{hyperref} \\PassOptionsToPackage{hyphens}{url} \\PassOptionsToPackage{dvipsnames,svgnames*,x11names*}{xcolor} % ... % more LaTeX code The LaTeX source is usually very long (200-500 lines + at least the number of lines in your markdown source). To find the next section, you can search for [makePDF] Run in the file. The “Run” messages ([makePDF] Run #1, [makePDF] Run #2…) give the LaTeX engine’s output messages. Generating PDFs from LaTeX typically requires several ‘runs’ of the LaTeX engine on the file: the first run generates various bits stored in an auxiliary file (e.g., which page a heading ends in, whether a citation is labelled Smith 2020 or Smith 2020a, …) and the second run uses them to finalize the PDF. Under each [makePDF] Run # you get the full LaTeX Log of the LaTeX engine. This is where you’ll find information, warnings and errors concerning PDF generation. For instance: [makePDF] Run #1 This is LuaHBTeX, Version 1.13.0 (TeX Live 2021) restricted system commands enabled.

This means we have no error or warning at pages 1 to 4, yay! Underfull and overfull \\hbox warnings, e.g. Underfull \\hbox (badness 2469). These indicate that LaTeX has generated a less-than-ideal horizontal line: an horizontal line with a bit too much, or not enough, text. Typically nothing to worry about: the text is just slightly more or less spaced than usual. However, very bad cases of overfull can be a table or long equation or image or some unbreakable large item that sticks out of your text block. The easiest is to check for them visually in the PDF output, but if you are after perfection you can check all the ones mentioned in the log. To know which pages they’re on, look for [n] page shipout indicators before and after the overfull message. If compilation runs without error, the end messages. These includes the warning if a LaTeX rerun is needed (LaTeX Warning: Label(s) may have changed. Rerun to get cross-references right.), which you don’t need to worry about because Pandoc takes care of this, and statistics about the output (Output written on input.pdf (18 pages, 113569 bytes).) If the PDF building from LaTeX has failed, you will see LaTeX error messages. For instance: ! Missing $ inserted. &lt;inserted text&gt; $ l.6 ! ==&gt; Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced! Transcript written on dummy.log. The error message starts with !, followed by a (more or less useful) description of the message, and an excerpt of the LaTeX code before and after the error occurred, and the line the engine was processing when the error occurred. Here the error was a missing $: in LaTeX $ is used to surround mathematical formulas, and each ‘opening’ dollar sign must be matched with a ‘closing’ one. The error was produced as the engine was processing line 6. Important. The line at which the error occurred is not necessarily the line where the mistake is. For instance, with matching $ the error is at the point where the engine realizes that the number of $ isn’t matched. But typically the mistake was earlier on, where a $ sign should have been. To diagnose and solve LaTeX error you need knwoledge and experience of LaTeX, which is beyond the scope of this guide. It often helps to make an internet search on the error message text. 12.3 pandoc says “Error”unknown option “citeproc”” Your need to update pandoc to a newer version. “Citeproc” (the pandoc extension that prints bibliographies, and replaces BibTeX/BibLaTeX) is only in versions &gt;2.11 (september 2020). How to update depends on how you’ve installed it: download from pandoc page, or do brew –upgrade (if you’re using homebrew for MacOS), etc. 12.4 pandoc says pandoc: FILENAME: OpenBinaryFile: file not found pandoc doesn’t find one of the files needed. The instructions above work only if: your execute the pandoc command while located in the folder that contains your markdown file and its bibliography while. (Learn how to navigate folders in the command line, and go where your markdown file is.) that folder is located three folders down from the workhouse’s base folder (the folder where the processing, resources folders are located). So your markdown file can be in: processing/2020-01-special-issue/01-michels finished/2020-02-issue/01-elzein … The file resources/defaults.yaml contains our default settings for pandoc, and they also assume that your file is three folder down from the base. This is why we preface resources/defaults with ../../../ in our pandoc command (to indicate that the file is three folder up from where you are when you run pandoc). If you want to run pandoc with our settings on a file that’s located elsewhere, you can use the full command. You can figure it out from resource/defaults.yaml. At present this would be: pandoc --standalone --pdf-engine=xelatex --citeproc --csl=PATH/TO/dialectica.csl --template=PATH/TO/dltc-template.tex SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf but the details might change as we update our defaults. You may add any additional option you wish. PATH/TO/ should be replaced with the path from your folder to the templates. For instance, if the templates and style files are respectively in in: journal-new/design/templates journal-new/biblio/ and your manuscript is in: journal-new/articles/issue-01/ You could try: pandoc --standalone --pdf-engine=xelatex --citeproc --csl=../../biblio/biblio-style,csl --template=../../design/templates/dltc-template.tex SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf That is, ../../ going two folders up (hence at journal/new) and from there down biblio in one case and design/templates in the other. You can also create your own defaults file mydefaults.yaml in a text editor, with contents like: standalone: true pdf-engine: xelatex citeproc: true csl: ../../biblio/biblio-style,csl template: ./../design/templates/dltc-template.tex Save it next to your manuscript and run pandoc with: pandoc -d mydefaults SOURCE.md -o OUTPUT.pdf "],["about-markdown-copyediting.html", "Chapter 13 About Markdown copyediting 13.1 Aims 13.2 Style 13.3 What to encode 13.4 About Markdown 13.5 Advance warnings", " Chapter 13 About Markdown copyediting NOTE TO SELF: this chapter should be reorganized. and probably divided. It has three components: - the aims of markup editing, what markdown is, and the like. Not hands-on, best moved to the publishing part. - basics of markdown syntax, ‘advance warnings’, using RStudio. This is hands-on, should be here. There should also a roadmap to the copyediting chapters ahead. - detailed prescriptions about what to encode or not. Not sure where to fit that. 13.1 Aims In an automated copyediting workflow, the job of the copyeditor isn’t to fine-tune the appearance of the output (fonts, spacing, etc.) Rather, the copyeditor’s job is to encode all, and only, the manuscript’s features that the automatic converter needs to know about. Typical manuscripts (MS Word documents, LaTeX file) contain both too much and too little information for a publisher’s purposes. A MS Word file contains information about font use and margin size, which the publisher must get rid of since they’re applying their own font and margins. It also typically fails to encode crucial information in in a machine-readable way. For instance, an author may: use mere boldface to indicate their section titles: 1. Methods. A human reader understands that they mean a section heading. But an automatic converter needs to know that this is section title, and not a simple bold text, to typeset it correctly. manually write ‘(Dupuis 2020, pp. 29-42)’ for their citations. If an automatic converter knows that this is a citation of a given paper, at a given page range, it can turn it into a link, format it consistently throughout the journal (instead of ‘2020: 29–42’ in some papers and ‘2019, pp.12-15’ in others), and check that all and only references cited appear in the bibliography. manually write internal cross-references (“see fn. 6”, “see page 8”). If an automatic converter knows that these are meant to refer to other parts of the text, they can turn them into links and adjust them if the numbering changes. Our copyediting task is to remove unnecessary formatting, and turn important features into codes that the automatic processor can pick up and deal with. Markdown is a light-weight, intuitive way of encoding meaningful features. For instance: a *simple* solution encodes a word that needs to be emphasized (typically, italics, but it’s for the automatic converter to decide). # Methodology encodes a heading titled “Methodology”. [@Doe2019, 22-29] encodes a citation of the pages 22 to 29 of an article that the converter will find under the name Doe2019 in the article’s associated bibliography file. 13.2 Style We will rely on the Chicago Manual of Style in most cases, except where we state otherwise. 13.3 What to encode Here is a list of features we need to encode in a way that our automatic processor understand. The list is in progress; and not everything on that list can be handled yet. Feature Syntax? Imple men-tation? Note Headings [ x] [x] Paragraphs [ x] [x] Footnotes [ x] [x] Emphasis (italics, bold) [ x] [x] Superscripts and subscripts [ x] [x] Citations [ x] [x] Cross-reference: heading [ x] [x] Cross-reference: footnote [ x] [ ] Cross-reference: specific location [ x] [ ] Must be handled separately in PDF vs HTML. Cross-reference: image, figure, table [ x] [ ] Cross-reference: theorem, statement Quotations: block quotations [ x] [x] Encoding the source too? Quotations: inline [ x] [x] Unnecessary. Ordinary ’ or ” is enough.

For instance, the double square brackets should not be entered as [[ and ]] but with their LaTeX codes \\\\llbracket and \\rrbracket. 13.4 About Markdown Markdown is a syntax enhance plain tex with machine-readable information, a.k.a. ‘markup’. More specifically, we’ll use pandoc’s Markdown - the variant of that syntax that is most suited to academic texts and that is fully understood by our automatic converter, pandoc. The copyediting files we work on are thus in pandoc’s Markdown format (extension .md). These are just plain text documents, which can be edited with any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, …), but where we use a certain codes to encode information needed by our automatic document converter (pandoc). For instance, a document may contain the line: In this article, I will prove that the *metaphysical* question is not nonsense. where the * encode the fact that the word “metaphysical” is emphasised. The automatic converter can pick up on that information and typeset the word accordingly in the PDF and HTML outputs. Typically, emphasized words are typeset in italics, but we could decide to typeset them with small caps or letter spacings as well. So we only encode the fact that the word is to be emphasized, using the * notation, and leave the rest to the converter. The official documentation of pandoc’s Markdown can be used to supplement the instructions below. 13.5 Advance warnings 13.5.1 Watch out for special characters Used in certain ways, characters below (and some others) are treated as formatting instructions by Markdown: \\ &amp; * $ [ ] _ @ Normally, you shouldn’t have to worry about them. But if they aren’t visible or your markdown file generates error when turned into PDF, they may be the culprit. Typically the error can be avoided by ‘escaping’ the character, i.e. preceding it with a backslash. Hence: \\&amp; means &amp; (nb, mandatory in BibTeX files!) \\* means * \\\\ means \\ \\$ means $ Etc. The one exception is the square brackets. Markdown syntax allows \\[ ... \\] to be used to mark display formulas (mathematical or symbolic formulas that are shown on their own line) and \\( ... \\) inline formulas (formulas in the middle of the text). We prefer using the other syntax to write formulas, $$ ... $$ for display formulas and $ ... $ for inline one. Unfortunately, RStudio’s visual editor uses the former convention. So if you try and escape square brackets or parentheses this might fail and your escape bracket may be wrongly understood as an equation marker (more on this below). Besides that escaping works well. Here are some problem cases you might encounter: A reference cited is titled Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas. You have the title with &amp; in your BibTeX file, and it generates an error. The problem is that in LaTeX/BibTeX &amp; is a special character (to indicate tabs). Solution: ‘escape’ the ampersand in your BibTeX file: title = {Fear \\&amp; Loathing in Las Vegas} Your text has a pair of asterisks: Principle (*) is strong. Principle (*) is stronger than Principle (**). The text between the asterisks is wrongly interpreted as emphasized: Principle () is strong. Principle () is stronger than Principle (**). Solution: escape the asterisks: Principle (\\*) is strong. Principle (\\*) is stronger than Principle (\\*\\*). Principle (*) is strong. Principle (*) is stronger than Principle (**). If two $ appear in a paragraph, the in-between text will be wrongly treated as a formula if there is no space to the right of the first and to the left of the second. This can happen in rare cases: she gave him notes of $10 and $20, it&#39;ll be all right. she gave him notes of $10 and $20, it’ll be all right. Solution: escape the $: she gave him notes of \\$10 and \\$20, it&#39;ll be all right. she gave him notes of $10 and $20, it’ll be all right. Square brackets for elided texts in citations. In practically all cases they’ll be fine. The following markdown code will display as intended, for instance: The [simple] models [...] are useful There’s only trouble in a rare case: the elided text matches a section header. For instance, suppose you have: The simple [models] are useful. ## Models This is wrongly interpreted as a link: The simple models are useful. Why? Pandoc automatically assign the header “Models” a link identifier: models (see the chapter on cross-referencing). And if this identifier is present, [models] becomes a link to it. And one of the section headings is “Models”. Solutions: If you’re working in markdown code, leave it as is. We run pandoc with an option that disables these links. If you’re working in the RStudio visual mode, the editor will replace these by an explicit link, encoded [models](#models) You have to manually remove that link when you’re finished editing. 13.5.2 RStudio visual markdown editor: source vs visual mode When you open a .md file in RStudio, you’ll see it in ‘source’ (or pure text) mode. By clicking the A-like grey icon on the top right (see image below), you can switch to ‘visual’ (visually formatted) mode. When switching to the visual editor for the first time with a given file, it will ask you about “Line wrapping”. Select the last option, “Use the current global default line wrapping for this document”. Warning. At present the visual editor breaks down numbered examples.

For example, one of the fields is named title and its value is the title of the paper (say, The Greatest Paper this Year). Another field is named bibliography and its value is the name of the bibliography file, say mybiblio.bib. The field names are mostly self-explanatory: title is for the title, thanks for the acknowledgments, etc. If you use the template above, simply remove any field that is not relevant to your article (e.g. keywords or thanks). Only header-includes is not obvious: it is used when an article relies on special LaTeX packages (or HTML scripts), otherwise it should be omitted. These are written in the form fieldname: value, in one line. Note the space after the colon. You can enclose the value in single (') or double (\") quotation marks. BAD GOOD title:An interesting fact title:'An interesting fact' title: An interesting fact title: 'An interesting fact' In case the value of a field occupies more than one line, you indicate this with the | character, and enter it as follows.

(You can also de-indent by selecting them and pressing Shift+Tab.) 14.1 Title (and other one-line fields) Can be inserted as they are, and may include markdown codes and/or maths formulas. But they should occupy one line only; if you need several lines, use the | character as indicated above. Quotation marks (’ … ’, or “…”) are optional; if you add them they won’t be printed. Markdown Printed title title: An Interesting Fact title: 'An Interesting Fact' title: \"An Interesting Fact\" An Interesting Fact Quotation marks must be used if the title itself contains a colon followed by a space (as in Formalization: a dummy's guide) or quotation marks (as in The Meaning of 'meaning'). Unless your enter your title as several lines using |: in that case, it should not be surrounded by quotation marks. When the title contains quotation marks (' or \"), you should enclose it with the other style of quotation marks. BAD GOOD title: A \"good\" friend title: A 'good' friend title: My Life: a Long Story title: 'A \"good\" friend' title: \"A 'good' friend\" title: \"My Life: A Long Story\" A common source of error: you break a line in a middle of a field’s value and continue on the next line. Then pandoc interprets the next line not as part of the value, as you intended, but as a new field altogether, and can’t make sense of the rest of your block. For instance, the following will generate an error: title: &#39;Introduction: The Formalization of arguments with various applications&#39; author: Robert Michels Why? Because the second line starts with ‘arguments’, which pandoc takes to be the name of a metadata field, which it doesn’t understand and complains about. Instead, there should be no manual line-break within the title: title: &#39;Introduction: The Formalization of arguments with various applications&#39; author: Robert Michels Genuine vs apparent linebreak. Your text editor is likely set up to “soft wrap” long lines. This means that a very long line is in apparence broken and displayed as several lines. In the file though, and most importantly in the eyes of the computer, it remains a single line.4 When a text editor displays line numbers, you can tell that a line is soft-wrapped by the fact that doesn’t introduce a new line number. Another way to tell that your editor is soft-wrapping is to resize the windows: if the linebreaks are rearranged so that your text is showing, your editor is soft-wrapping and hence what looks like a new line could just be the continuation of a previous line. (To check that this happens, reduce the size of your windows: are the line breaks changed to fit the new window? if yes, then your display is “soft-wrapped”.) If your editor as line numbers on the left (e.g. RStudio, sublime), you can tell which are the genuine If you aren’t sure whether there’s a line-break in the middle of your title (between various and applications in the title above, say), you can: widen your editor’s window and see whether the text moves back up to the original line, or otherwise go to the beginning of the second line, hit backspace to ‘glue’ the two words (variousapplications), and hit the space key to make sure that they’re separated by a space and not a line-break. 14.2 Additional title fields 14.2.1 Short title If the title is too long to fit in the header, you can specify a short title in addition: title: An extremely long-winded and verbose title about a range of topics including but not restricted to the weather shorttitle: A long-winded title about the weather This will be used in the table of contents too. 14.2.2 Linebreaks in a title Requires: dialectica templates. In LaTeX/PDF output it is sometimes useful to manually specify a line break within the title. There are two fields to provide this, title-latex and title-cover: title: A Very Long Title that Can be Broken in Various Places title-latex: | A Very Long Title that \\ Can be Broken in Various Places title-cover: | A Very Long Title that Can be\\ Broken in Various Places In a metadata field, the \\ at then end of a line specifies a linebreak. Warning: it must be immediately followed by an end of line (no spaces!). title-latex controls the title on the first page (“chapter” title). It also sets the offprint cover page unless title-cover is also supplied. title-cover controls the title on the offprint’s cover page. If you want title-latex to modify the first page’s title only, simply insert title-cover with the same content as title. The title field must be provided, even if title-cover and/or title-latex are given By default titles on the offprint’s cover are of LaTeX size \\Huge if they are less than 31 characters long, otherwise the slightly smaller size \\huge. You can specify a custom LaTeX size if needed (\\Huge, \\huge, \\LARGE, \\Large, \\large etc.) with the title-cover-size field. This only affects LaTeX/PDF output. title-cover-size: \\huge 14.2.3 Subtitle You can provide a subtitle with the subtitle key: title: Frankenstein subtitle: The Modern Prometheus Requires: dialetica templates. Dialectica’s template typeset the subtitle thus: On the paper’s title page, it is printed below the title, in smaller font. In the table of contents, it is printed after a colon: Frankenstein: The Modern Promoetheus You can override the colon by specifying a subtitle separator, e.g. a simple space: title: So What? subtitle: My Quest for the Meaning of Life subtitleseparator: &#39; &#39; As with title, you can use the additional subtitle-latex, subtitle-cover, subtitle-cover-size to add linebreaks in the first page and cover subtitles and to control the size of the cover subtitle if needed. You must still provide the subtitle key. title: So What? subtitle: My Quest for the Meaning of Life subtitle-separator: &#39; &#39; subtitle-latex: | My Quest\\ for the Meaning of Life subtitle-cover: | My Quest\\ for the Meaning of Life subtitle-cover-size: \\Large 14.3 Author(s) information Requires. The scholarly-metadata and scholarly-format filters. We specify author information as follows. author: - name: Susan Stebbing email: s.stebbing@kcl.ac.uk correspondence: true institute: &quot;King&#39;s College London&quot; Note that there is a dash (-) before the first line (name field), and that all the other lines begin with a couple of spaces. correspondence: true is needed to indicate that the email address should be printed. Here we have put the affiliation in \" quotes because it contains a special symbol (the ' quote sign). When we have several authors, each gets a block that starts with a dash: author: - name: Susan Stebbing email: s.stebbing@kcl.ac.uk correspondence: true institute: &quot;King&#39;s College London&quot; - name: Cecil Day-Lewis institute: Cambridge University You can specify several affiliations for an author: author: - name: Susan Stebbing email: s.stebbing@kcl.ac.uk correspondence: true institute: - &quot;King&#39;s College London&quot; - Bedford College, London You can also specify a list of affiliations separately, and associate each author to their affiliations. This is most useful when several authors share the same affiliation: institute: - kcl: &quot;King&#39;s College London&quot; - bedford: Bedford College, London author: - name: Susan Stebbing institute: [kcl, beford] - name: &quot;Jane Q. Doe&quot; institute: bedford Here kcl, bedford are used as internal keys to associate each author with their affiliations - they won’t be printed. Note that if an author has several affiliations, they should be listed in brackets, separated by commas: [kcl, bedford]. Where there is only one the brackets are optional: for Jane Q. Doe above we could have written institute: [bedford] as well. You can do without keys too, by listing the affiliations in some order and using numbers to refer to them. The metadata below is equivalent to the above: institute: - &quot;King&#39;s College London&quot; - Bedford College, London author: - name: Susan Stebbing institute: [1, 2] - name: Jane Doe institute: [2] See the scholarly-metadata filter page for more options and information. 14.4 Author in page header and table of contents Requires. The dialectica template. You may sometimes need to typset the authors differently in the page header and table of contents. This is done using the author-header and author-toc keys: author: - name: Doe, Alice - name: Doe, Brit - name: Doe, Celia - name: Doe, Denis - name: Doe, Ethne author-header: Doe et al. author-toc: Doe A., Doe B., Doe C., Doe D., and Doe E. 14.5 Abstract and thanks Fields like abstract and thanks usually spread over several lines. If so, the field starts with a “I” and the content is written below. Each line should start with a space (so that the computer knows it’s still the abstract, and not a new metadata field). For instance, this would break down: abstract: | The purpose of this introduction is to give a rough overview of the discussion of the formalization of arguments, focusing on deductive arguments. Because “discussion” is at the beginning of a line, so Pandoc assumes it’s a new field rather than the continuation of the multiline text. Instead you should have a space at the beginning of every line: abstract: | The purpose of this introduction is to give a rough overview of the discussion of the formalization of arguments, focusing on deductive arguments. Dialectica guidelines. Abstracts are strongly recommended. Most people who bump on the article will only read that. They must be at most 200 words or so, to fit in the first article page. 14.6 Keywords (and other lists) In some cases the content is a list, and in those case the syntax is as with a list of authors: keywords: - speculative metaphysics - nonsense 14.7 Bibliography The name of the associated .bib file. Important. The bibliography field cannot be empty. This: title: My paper author: Jane E. Doe bibliography: Will generate a Pandoc error File not found in resource path. 14.8 And more generally… More generally format is simple, each entry is of the form: field : content List entries are: field : - item 1 - item 2 List within lists are sometimes used field : - first list - item 1 - item 2 - another list - object 1 - object 2 Multiline fields start with |, followed by one or more lines that each start at least one space: field : | This very verbose field contains a bunch of text that spans over a few lines to allow the author to vent a few grudges. Technically: a text file is just a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, spaces, etc.). But among those is the special “newline” character that ends a line. It’s sometimes displayed as a backwards P, or a carriage return arrow. Real lines are sequences of characters between newlines characters. Hard wrapping is cutting a line by adding a newline character. By contrast, soft-wrapping doesn’t add a newline character in the file, doesn’t create a real new line, and is just a matter of appearance.↩︎ "],["inline-elements.html", "Chapter 15 Inline elements 15.1 Punctuation 15.2 Emphasis and bold 15.3 Subscripts and superscripts 15.4 Hyphens and dashes 15.5 Quotations 15.6 Special symbols 15.7 Math and logic conventions 15.8 Formulas 15.9 Schematic letters in the text 15.10 Split fractions 15.11 Acronyms 15.12 Foreign words 15.13 Line break 15.14 Prevent line breaks", " Chapter 15 Inline elements A traditional document consists of lines of text organized into blocks. A markdown document is likewise organized into inline elements that are put together into blocks. Inline elements words and spaces, a few words in italics, a formula in the flow of the text, such as \\(x+y=c\\). Block elements paragraphs section headings images, figures, tables display formulas … This chapter deals with copyediting inline elements. It also deals with formulas, which can be treated as both inline and blocks. 15.1 Punctuation 15.1.1 Punctuation and brackets: If only part of the sentence is in parentheses, put the final punctuation outside of the parenthesis: I enjoy breakfast (sometimes). If the entire sentence is in parenthesis, put the punctuation inside the parenthesis. I enjoyed breakfast. (I always do.) 15.1.2 Punctuation and quotation marks There are two traditions, the traditional British and the US/modern British. (TO BE DETAILED) Note. Pandoc’s Citeproc filter will apply the US convention, even in the main text. For instance it will convert the following markdown: She never said the word &#39;traitor&#39;. to She never said the word ‘traitor.’ This can be avoided globally by setting the document’s language to en-GB. It can be avoided on a case-by-case basis by using a “zero-width joiner” characters, markdown code &amp;zmj;: She never said the word &#39;traitor&#39;&amp;zmj;. She never said the word ‘traitor’&amp;zmj;. Dialectica guidelines Dialectica adopts the US/Chicago convention, unless authors insist otherwise or the results are particularly problematic. 15.1.3 Quotes with quotes Good typographic practice requires using different quotation marks when embedding quotes within quotes. Examples: GOOD “This ‘word’ is quoted”. GOOD ‘This “word” is quoted’. If you try to put double quotes with double quotes, Pandoc doesn’t output them correctly. BAD Consider \"This \"word\" is quoted\"...: Consider “This”principle” is quoted”… It is best to impose the rule unless authors really need the same quotes. If they are really needed, you can use HTML entites name of the opening and closing quotes: GOOD: \"This &amp;ldquo;word&amp;rdquo; is quoted\". “This “word” is quoted” GOOD: 'This &amp;lsquo;word&amp;rsquo; is quoted'. ‘This ‘word’ is quoted’ 15.2 Emphasis and bold Emphasized text is marked with surrounding asterisks or underscores. Bold is marked with double asterisks or underscores, emphasized bold with three: This *word* and _that word_ are emphasized. This **word** and __that word__ are strongly emphasized. ***This sentence is extra strongly emphasized.*** Emphasis is printed in italics when surrounded with normal text. But when the surrounding text is itself in italics, this is the opposite. Dialectica guidelines Use simple emphasis only. Avoid strong emphasis (bold), which stands out too much on the page. Simple emphasis (italics, one asterisk or underscore) is used: - for emphasis, - for labels of principles in statements: Principle of Compositionality. for mentioned words (e.g. in philosophy of language papers): The verb know has two meanings for simple symbols (when the paper doesn’t use formulas otherwise): S knows that p. Bold should be only used in limited cases: some acronyms for a principle (PC), a system of logic (S4). 15.3 Subscripts and superscripts Subscripts and superscripts in markdown text are coded as follows: I want I type A sub1 script and a sup1 script (when attached to plain text words). A sub~1~ script and a sup^1^ script. Water is H2O. Water is H~2~O. The no 1 activity The n^o^\\ 1 activity Most often, though, superscripts and subscripts are part of LaTeX formulas. The code is then entered as follows. I want I type With \\(p_1\\) and \\(p^2\\) the sub(/super)scripts are in formulas. With $p_1$ and $p^2$ the... With \\(p_{12}\\) and \\(p^{**}\\) the sub(/super)scripts are several characters long. With $p_{12}$ and $p^{xy}$ the... Note that in LaTeX, when your sub(/super)script is more than one character longs, it needs to be enclosed in curly braces. 15.4 Hyphens and dashes The hyphen - is used between words: An eye-popping headline. En-dashes -- between numbers: Pages 17–19. Em-dashes --- for inserts: He bailed out—and never came back. In standard English typesetting, the latter should not be surrounded by spaces. GOOD: They---or their friends---weren't having it. BAD: They --- or their friends --- weren't having it. Note that end of lines in markdown are treated as spaces by Pandoc, so to avoid surrounding spaces the --- dash should not be at the beginning or end of a line. For a non-breaking hyphen, use the HTML code &amp;#8209;: ... $\\supset$&amp;#8209;analysis... prints out as ‘\\(\\supset\\)‑analysis’ and the hyphen cannot be at a linebreak. Dialectica guidelines Em-dashes are not surrounded by spaces. 15.5 Quotations This is for inline quotations. Cf. the block chapter for block quotations. Dialectica guidelines For inline quotations use double quotation marks: What they call “best practice” is a hack. 15.6 Special symbols A guiding principle: try to use LaTeX formulas for maths, but only for maths. For these “HTML entities” are useful: these are codes of the form &amp;..; for special characters, e.g. &amp;nbsp; for a non-breakable space or &amp;rarr; and &amp;larr; for right and left arrows. Various websites allow you to search for HTML entities; try this one for instance. Using HTML entities requires a font with fairly good unicode support. If your font miss a particular HTML entity, you will get a warning. If that’s the case you can try using a LaTeX formula instead (e.g. $\\rightarrow$). But for non-math content HTML entities are preferable. because they make your content more machine-readable. Latin characters with diacritics (å, é, è, ü, ø, etc.) should be entered as such, not in LaTeX codes. Greek text (not: Greek letters in maths) should be entered as such, provided your font covers Greek as well as Latin. § should be simply entered §, because it’s a fairly basic character available on your keyboard and most fonts. Not its LaTeX equivalent, $\\S$. → and ←, when used outside of a logical formula (say “the appearance→reality principle”) should be inserted as HTML entities: &amp;rarr; and &amp;larr;. If they are absent from your font, you can use their LaTeX math version as a fallback: $\\rightarrow$ and $leftarrow$. Prime, double prime in labels. E.g. you want a list with items labelled A′, A″, A‴, A⁗. Use &amp;prime; (one prime), &amp;Prime; (two), &amp;tprime; (three), &amp;qprime; (four). You should not go beyond that, but if really needed, use math as fallback: A$'''''$, (A\\(&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;\\)), A$''''''$. Number subscripts and superscripts. For mathematical names, e.g.  variables, use math mode: $c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$ (\\(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n\\)) and $c^1, c^2, \\ldots, c^n$ (\\(c^1, c^2, \\ldots, c^n\\)). Note that in LaTeX sub/superscripted bits of more than one character should be in curly braces, e.g. c^{10} (\\(c^10\\)). For names that aren’t mathematical, e.g. custom labels A1, A2, …, use Pandoc’s subscripts and superscripts: A^1^, A^12^, B~2~, … (A1, A12, B2). Asterisks. For labels A*, A** etc. use * as is: A*, A**. Not the LaTeX $A^{*}$ (\\(A^{*}\\)). Therefore (∴): &amp;there4;, not the LaTeX formula $\\therefore$. 15.7 Math and logic conventions These are decided by your house style. Dialectica guidelines. Propositional connectives: \\lnot (\\(\\lnot\\)) rather than \\sim (\\~). (those who prefer the latter should note that \\sim doesn’t have operator spacing in LaTeX, better redefine \\lnot to print ~ with math operator spacing.) Resources: many websites allow you to search for HTML entites code. 15.8 Formulas 15.8.1 Basics If the author’s manuscript includes formulas, make sure they are in MS Word / Google Docs Equation mode before converting to markdown. pandoc will then convert them in LaTeX formulas, which will greatly simplify your work. An “inline” formula, that is a formula within the flow of the text, is delimited by $ signs. For instance, this: The principle of non-contradition, \\(\\lnot (\\phi \\land \\lnot \\phi)\\) is Leibniz’s… is coded: The principle of non-contradition, $\\lnot (\\phi \\land \\lnot \\phi)$ is Leibniz&#39;s... A “display” formula, one that occupies more than one line, is delimited by $$ signs. For instance, this: Leibniz’s law, \\[\\forall x \\forall y (x=y \\rightarrow \\forall X (Xx \\leftrightarrow Xy))\\] is … is coded: Leibniz&#39;s law, $$\\forall x \\forall y (x=y \\rightarrow \\forall X (Xx \\leftrightarrow Xy))$$ is ... Display formulas are ‘block’ elements. For more or them, in particular, numbering them, see the Equations. Do not leave a space after the opening $ or before the closing one, otherwise markdown thinks they are ordinary dollar signs. GOOD: $\\forall x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$ BAD: $ \\forall x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx) $ Can pandoc confuse ordinary dollar signs and formula delimiters? Normally not. In the following: Amounts of $20,000 and $30,000 are... Pandoc will not think that $20,000 and $ is a formula, because the last $ is preceded by a space. If, however, for some reason you need to typeset something like: Amounts of $20,000 and 0.00$ are... where Pandoc will turn into a formula, “escape” the dollar signs: Amounts of \\$20,000 and 0.00\\$ are... Amounts of $20,000 and 0.00$ are… 15.8.2 Good practices Do not break up a formula apart into its individual symbols. For instance, this: The formulas \\(\\exists x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)\\), \\(\\forall x\\neg\\text{Gx}\\) are quantified formulas. Should be entered in markdown as: The formulas $\\exists x(Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$, $\\forall x\\neg\\text{Gx}$ are quantified formulas. Not as: The formulas $\\exists$ x (Fx $\\rightarrow$ Gx), $\\forall$ x$\\neg$Gx are quantified formulas. Do not enter a list of formulas as a single formula (with exceptions). Merging two formulas into one prevents linbreaks between them in the output: GOOD: $\\exists x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx)$, $\\forall x \\lnot Gx$. BAD: $\\exists x (Fx \\rightarrow Gx), \\forall x \\lnot Gx$. Exception: if you have lists of small items as in \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots , p_n\\), no need to split those into many equations: GOOD: $p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$5 ALSO GOOD: $p_1$, $p_2$, ..., $p_n$. Another exception, list of premises in a formula stating that they entail a conclusion: \\(A, B, \\vDash C\\) GOOD: $A, B, \\vDash C$ BAD: $A$, $B$, $vDash C$ The latter might look right but it is not accurate in e.g. a machine-readable JATS XML export, as the whole line here should be treated as a single claim (that \\(A\\),\\(B\\) entail \\(C\\)), not three claims (\\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(\\vDash C\\)). Elements of formulas repeated in the text are entered as formulas too. For instance this: In the formula \\(\\exists xFx\\) the variable \\(x\\) is bound. is coded thus: GOOD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable $x$ is... BAD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable x is... BAD: In the formula $\\exists xFx$ the variable *x* is... Note that *x* is not in formula mode and not a suitable replacement for $x$ here. While both would be displayed in italics, their meaning is different (on indicates emphasis, the other indicates an element of a formula) and they are subtle differences in typesetting (different font and spacing for formulas). Similarly: If a subject \\(S\\) has property \\(P\\) GOOD: If a subject $S$ has property $P$... BAD: If a subject S has property P... BAD: If a subject *S* has property *P*... BAD: If a subject **S** has property **P**... Ordinary text within formulas. Some authors put ordinary text within formulas: \\(\\exists\\Phi(\\textrm{All }\\Phi\\textrm{ one})\\) You should put that text within the formula LaTeX code, using \\textrm{...} for normal text, and \\textit{...} for italic, \\textbf{...} for bold, \\texttt{...} for code. BAD: ($\\exists\\Phi$)(All $\\Phi$ One) GOOD: $(\\exists\\Phi)(\\textrm{All} \\Phi \\textrm{One})$ This makes more sense (the first is one formula, the second is two mixed with the text) and the spacing will be better. 15.9 Schematic letters in the text Schematic letters in the main text should normally be typeset as formulas: I want I type \\(S\\) knows that \\(p\\) $S$ knows that $p$ \\(n\\)-ary predicate $n$-ary predicate \\(F\\)-ness $F$-ness \\(\\mathrm{F}\\)-ness $\\mathrm{F}$-ness This does not apply to acronyms, e.g. “PP” for the Precautionary Principle. Remark. If there are few, e.g \\(S\\), \\(p\\), and they don’t appear in formulas proper such as \\(K_Sp\\), then it can be tolerated to enter them as is (S) or with emphasis to obtain italics (*p*). We advise against this because *...* indicates emphasis and not a symbol or italics. For instance, if the markdown source is later fed into text-to-speech software the read out will wrongly stress *p* wherever it’s used. Some mathematic texts use upright uppercase letters and lowercase italicized letters.6 To get upright letters with math mode use the \\mathrm{...} LaTeX command. All letters within {...} will be typset as upright serif letters (“roman” is another name for serif): I want I type \\(\\mathrm{MA}p\\) $\\mathrm{MA}p$ \\(\\mathrm{M}Ap\\) \\mathrm{M}Ap \\(\\mathrm{A+B}\\) \\mathrm{A+B} If the predicates are referred to in the text around, I would make sure there are in dollar signs too: Predicate \\(F\\) is unary, predicate \\(G\\) binary. GOOD Predicate $F$ is unary, predicate $G$ binary. NOT ADVISED Predicate F is unary, predicate G binary. NOT ADVISED Predicate *F* is unary, predicate *G* binary. 15.10 Split fractions Fractions like 2/3, 1/2, can (and are often better) be printed out as split fractions, with the first number slightly up and left and the lower slightly down and right. This is best achieved with the LaTeX xfrac package. Add the following to the header-includes metadata field: header-includes: | \\usepackage{xfrac} and enter the fractions in formulas like so: $\\sfrac{2}{3}$ Downside: these are not handled by mathjax in HTML output, so they will have to be converted to images by your template. 15.11 Acronyms Cf “Abbreviations” chapter in the Chicago manual. Acronyms are in caps, not bold. Exception: logic contexts, where axiom schemas, systems of logic, etc. may be labelled in bold. 15.12 Foreign words Cf “Italics, Capitals, and Quotation Marks” of the Chicago manual. In summary: Not italics if they are “familiar”, i.e. appear in the Webster’s dictionary. Italics otherwise. Exception: if you have two nearby each other and one is unfamiliar, make both italics for consistency (e.g. mise en scène and mise en bouteille). Some common cases: Familiar. A priori, a posteriori, ceteris paribus, inter alia, ad hominem, modus ponens Unfamiliar. Salva veritate, ex falso quodlibet, … 15.13 Line break Exceptionally you may need a line break that does not start a new paragraph. This is encoded by finishing a line with a backlash. Thus the following: This line ends here and a new one starts. is encoded as follows: This line ends here \\ and a new one starts. 15.14 Prevent line breaks Sometimes you need to prevent line breaks. If you use suppressed-author references, they are awkard at the beginning of lines as in: … Smith’s great theory (1972). On the other … The code for this would be: ... Smith&#39;s great theory [-@Smith1972]. On the other hand To prevent this use non-breakable spaces, which can be introduced with a backclashed-escaped space \\ or with the HTML code &amp;nbsp;, as follows: ... Smith&#39;s great theory\\ [-@Smith1972]. On the other hand ... Smith&#39;s great theory&amp;nbsp;[-@Smith1972]. On the other hand Don’t use this to fine-tune how the long the lines are or the like; only when it makes sense in terms of the content: when it’s a matter of sticking say a citation year to what’s going with it, “i.e.” to what follows, and the like. \\ldots is LaTeX code for suspension dots.↩︎ Because latin lowercase letters come from handwritten Carolingian letters but latin uppercase letters come from stone-engraved Roman letters, some think that uppercase latin letters shouldn’t be used unless strictly necessary. The same can be said for uppercase/lowercase greek letters.↩︎ "],["block-elements.html", "Chapter 16 Block elements 16.1 Paragraphs 16.2 Headings 16.3 Footnotes and endnotes 16.4 Quotations 16.5 Lists 16.6 Crossreferencing and captioning tables, figures, images, equations 16.7 Tables 16.8 Figures (images, diagrams, graphs) 16.9 Equations 16.10 Theorems and proofs 16.11 Natural deduction proofs with bussproofs 16.12 Statements and indented blocks 16.13 Arguments 16.14 Multiple columns 16.15 Raw code if all else fails", " Chapter 16 Block elements A traditional document consists of lines of text organized into blocks.

Inline elements words and spaces, a few words in italics, a formula in the flow of the text, such as \\(x+y=c\\). Block elements paragraphs section headings images, figures, tables … This chapter deals with copyediting block elements. Footnotes are dealt with here with block elements. Formulas with inline elements, even if they are sometimes displayed as blocks. NOTE TO SELF: formula content is in the previous chapter, but equation blocks are dealt with here. Idea: treat formula content and LaTeX encoding in the previous chapter, but treat displaying formula and numbering here (with a reference to the previous chapter.) 16.1 Paragraphs New paragraphs are indicated in markdown by leaving an empty line. That is, an empty line separates two paragraphs. In typography paragraphs can be separated from each other in two ways: indentation of the first line (common in books) or vertical spacing (common on the web). In the first-line ident style, in some traditions (English) paragraphs don’t have a first-line ident after headings, in others (French) they do. Which style you adopt should be controlled by your template and not require special formatting in your markdown manuscript. Exceptionally you may need a line break that does not start a new paragraph. See the inline elements chapter. 16.1.1 First-line indentation after quotes, lists, etc. Requires: the first-indent-line filter. (If you don’t use it, see the alternative solution below.) Note: The advice of this section only matters if your journal uses the first-line indentation style for separating paragraphs. If the vertical spacing style is used instead, following the advice will do no harm but will not visibly affect the output. Problem. Text that directly follows a list, quote, figure, table or other indented material (statement) may either be a continuation of the previous paragraph or the beginning of a new one. That is a matter of meaning (is the text finishing the previous idea, or beginning a new idea?) and may not be clear-cut in all cases. If your journal uses first-line indentation to separate paragraphs, continuations should not be typset with an indented first line, but new paragraphs should. Solution. When the text below a quote, list etc. is a new paragraph, begin it with the code \\indent. If it’s a continuation, no need to add anything. (Though you may insert \\noindent at the beginning of the continuation text to remind yourself you have examined it and classified it as continuation.) If it is not clear whether the following text is a paragraph or not, you may ask the author or simply pick one way or the other. Example. In the text below, the text after the quote is a continuation of the paragraph before the quote, but the text after the table is a new paragraph, so we insert the \\indent code. The first study on that topic was @Obscureapaer. In detailing their results the authors concluded: &gt; It&#39;s unclear what is going on here. And we agree that this is was the data suggests, as shown by the fatality rates in the table below. Test group Control group ----------- ---------------- .9 .9 \\indent The second study on that topic was @Anotherobscure paper... Optionally, we could have inserted the code \\noindent at the beginning of the line And we agree that..., to remind ourselves that we treat this as a continuation of the previous paragraph. See the first-line-indent filter’s page for more options and information. Dialectica guideline. Our template uses the first-line indentation style of separating paragraph, and the first-line-indent filter. Text that is below a list, quote, figure, statement, … will be typeset as a continuation of the paragraph before unless it starts with the \\indent code. We add the \\indent code when it is a new paragraph. If in doubt, ask the author or typeset either way. Alternative solution. If your journal does not use the first-line-indent filter, you can only control first-line indentation for the LaTeX/PDF output, and the defaults are the opposite, namely: if the text after a quote, list etc. is a new paragraph, no need to add anything. (You may add \\indent if you wish.) if it is the continuation of the previous paragraph, add \\noindent at the beginning. Example: 16.1.2 Special first-line indentation cases Requires: first-line indent filter. If for some reason the first-line indentation needs to be added to or removed from a specific paragraph, just begin this paragraph with the corresponding code: \\noindent or \\indent. If you do not have the first-line indent filter, the codes \\noindent and \\indent will only affect LaTeX/PDF outputs. This should only be used in exceptional cases. If you need to add these codes regularly (e.g. to control first-line indentation after headings), your journal template is not set up correctly. Dialectica guideline. Except in the cases discussed in the previous section (text following a quote, list, statement or other indented material), we do not expect to need to adjust first-line indentation manually. 16.2 Headings Headings of different levels (section, subsection, subsubsection) are encoded as a line starting with #, ##, ### followed by the title. I want I type 1. Section heading # Section title 1.2 Subsection heading ## Subsection title 1.2.1 Subsubsection title ### Subsection title lower titles ####, #####, ###### In Dialectica headings are numbered up to the subsection (#, ##, ###). Headings of level four (####) are used for un-numbered smaller units. We have also two “inline” headings style, where the heading title is displayed at the beginning of the following paragraph rather than on its separate line. They are level 5 (#####) and level 6 (#######). We discourage authors from using headings below the subsection (##) in articles though, though we can use them if the they improve readibility. Do not manually add numbers to section headings. They are automatically added by the house template. BAD GOOD # 1 Methods # Methods # 1 # If the heading has no title, you should simply enter # (or the relevant level) with no title. If an article starts with an introduction section, that section should not have aheading. So do not start articles with: # Introduction 16.3 Footnotes and endnotes Your template decides whether notes are printed out as footnotes or endnotes. The encoding is the same whichever it uses. We’ll call them “notes” here. There are two ways to enter notes. The first is inline, without identifier. This is suitable for brief notes: This is the main text.7 This continues the main text. This is the main text.^[In footnote, I distract you with an irrelevant point.] This continues the main text. The second is a reference link, with identifier. This is suitable for longer notes, and required if a note has several paragraphs: This is the main text.8 This continues the main text. It spans over several paragaphs. @echo &quot;it even includes a code listing&quot;. This is the next paragraph that isn’t part of the footnote. his is the main text.[^myidentifier] This continues the main text. [^myidentifier]: This note takes more space. It spans over several paragaphs. ```bash @echo &quot;it even includes a code listing&quot;. This is the next paragraph that isn’t part of the footnote. Note that the `^` is outside of square brackets in the inline style, inside it in the reference style. In the reference style the footnote can be placed anywhere in the document (common choices are at the end of the current block or at the end of the current chapter, or at the end of the document or chapter). Numbers can be used as identifiers in the reference style: &gt; This is the main text.[^1] [^1]: this is the foonote. ```markdown &gt; This is the main text.[^1] [^1]: this is the foonote. This is not recommended if you are planning to fuse several documents, e.g. chapters of a book, as two [^1] footnotes in seperate chapters will generate a conflicting reference and an error message. The numbers here are identifiers only, they need not (and will probably not) match the ones in the final output. In multi-paragraph footnotes, indent each block with two spaces to indicate that it’s part of the footnote rather than resuming the main text, as in the example above. Cross-reference to footnotes has to be done manually. Don’t enter them before you know that the footnote numbers are final. See the cross-referencing chapter. Dialectica guidelines It’s fine to use link references with simple numbers: [^1], [^2]. These will be automatically generated by pandoc when converting the manuscripts and it is too time-consuming to replace them. Our production process ensures no conflict across two articles within the same issue. 16.4 Quotations Quotations should only be used for quoted material: text coming from another source. For other indented block of materials, cf Statements. Quotations are marked by either starting a paragraph with &gt; and indenting it, or by starting each line of the paragraph with &gt;, or simply having the first line starting with &gt; This is a quotation. The second sentence is on an indented line. This is another quotation. The second sentence is on a line starting with &gt;. This is quotation in the lazy style. The second line isn’t even indented or starting with &gt;. &gt; This is a quotation. The second sentence is on an indented line. &gt; This is another quotation. &gt; The second sentence is on a line starting with `&gt;`. &gt; This is quotation in the lazy style. The second line isn&#39;t even indented or starting with `&gt;`. For readability avoid the lazy style. The quotation citation can be included at the end or in foonote: I am happy. (Jane Doe 2020) I am sad.9 &gt; I am happy. [@doe_j:2020] &gt; I am sad.^[@doe_j:2020] You should distinguish several consecutive quotations from a single quotation with several paragraphs. One way to do this is as follows: This is a first quotation. This is a second quotation. This is not a third quotation, but a further paragraph of the second quotation. @echo &quot;this code block is yet a first block in that quotation too&quot; &gt; This is a first quotation. &gt; This is a second quotation. &gt; &gt; This is not a third quotation, but a further paragraph &gt; of the second quotation. &gt; &gt; ```bash &gt; @echo &quot;this code block is yet a first block in that quotation too&quot; &gt; ``` That is, we start all lines of the long quotation with &gt;, including the blank lines that separate its paragaphs or blocks. By contrast, we leave an empty line between two distinct quotations. An alternative is instead to only have &gt; at the beginning of a long quotation and indicate with subsequent paragraphs with an indent: This is a first quotation. This is still part of the first quotation. This is a second quotation. &gt; This is a first quotation. This is still part of the first quotation. &gt; This is a second quotation. You can have quotations within quotations. As someone said once: The life unexamined isn’t worth living. &gt; As someone said once: &gt; &gt; &gt; The life unexamined &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t worth living. 16.5 Lists 16.5.1 Simple lists Simple unnumbered lists * an item * a sub-item * another sub-item * an item Result: an item a sub-item another sub-item an item You can use - as well as *, and you can mix markers. Numbered lists: 1. item 2. item a. sub item b. sub item 3. another item Result item item sub item sub item another item Note that markdown ignores the particular number and number format you enter. a. apples b. peaches 2. pears 4. bananas 7. cherries Result apples peaches pears bananas cherries You can put blocks (paragraphs, quotations, etc.) as list items. To do so, align the following blocks with a couple of spaces: 1. This list item has not just one paragraph. It has two paragraphs. 2. &gt; This section list item &gt; contains a quotation. &gt; And the quotation is two &gt; paragraphs. Result This list item has not just one paragraph. It has two paragraphs. This section list item contains a quotation. And the quotation is two paragraphs. 16.5.2 What to do if a list has non-standard labels? Problem: a text has a list with regularly numbered items (1, 2, 3, or a, b, c, …) but uses * or ' labels in some cases. There are two solutions to this: If it’s not too important to single out some items with * or ', then you can re-number the author’s list, using a simple numbered list instead. If it is important to preserve the author’s labels, e.g. if it helps comprehension to see item ’2**’ as a revision of item ‘2’, then use custom label lists. 16.5.3 Numbered examples lists Some papers have examples (or other items) that are scattered throughout the paper but numbered continuously. For example: Sentence (1) below illustrates the Liar paradox: Sentence (1) is false. Not all self-referential sentences are paradoxical, however: This sentence contains several words. Sentence (3) is written in English. You enter those as follows using (@) or (@identifier): Sentence @liar below illustrates the Liar paradox: (@liar) Sentence (@liar) is false. Not all self-referential sentences are paradoxical, however: (@) This sentence contains several words. (@three) Sentence @three contains several words. (@) is enough to create a numbered example item. You add an identifier as in (@item3) if you need to refer to it later. To refer to it, simply use @identifier, as above, which you can wrap between parentheses if desired. Warning. References to numbered examples do not generate hyperlinks and cannot be placed within links. Problem. If a paragraph starts by a reference to a number example that you want to wrap between parentheses, markdown will wrongly think that it’s a new numbered example: The sentence below illustrates the Liar paradox: (@liar) Sentence (@liar) is false. (@liar) cannot be true, because... Solution. “Escape” (i.e., put a backslash in front of) the first parenthesis The sentence below illustrates the Liar paradox: (@liar) Sentence (@liar) is false. \\(@liar) cannot be true, because... 16.5.4 Custom labels lists Requires: the labelled-lists filter. A simple illustration of the custom label syntax: * [Premise 1]{} This is the first claim. * [Premise 2]{} This is the second claim. * [Conclusion]{} This is the conclusion. This generates the following list (process this file with the filter to see the result): Premise 1 This is the first claim. Premise 2 This is the second claim. Conclusion This is the conclusion. In general, the filter will turn a bullet list into a custom label list provided that every item starts with a Span element. A Span element is inline text (i.e., not block like a paragraph) that optinally has some attributes. The default syntax is [inline text]{attributes}. Inline text will be used as label, placed within round bracket. There is no need to specify attributes on the Span. But curly brackets must be present: [label] won’t work, [label]{} will. The label can include formatting. [**T1**]{} will generate a label with strong emphasis (bold by default). Span elements can also be entered using HTML syntax: &lt;span&gt;inline text &lt;/span&gt;. See [Pandoc manual] (https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) for details. If an article has many custom labelled lists with empty labels (see Arguments), you may set the delimiters to be empty rather than parentheses by default. See the labelled-lists.lua filter manual. 16.5.4.1 Commonly used custom labels See also the section on symbols. I want I type A*, A**, … A*, A**, … A′, A″, A‴, A⁗ A&amp;prime;, A&amp;Prime;, A&amp;tprime;, A&amp;qprime; A1, A2, … A^1^, A^2^, … A1, A2, … A~1~, A~2~, … 16.5.4.2 Cross-referencing custom-label items Custom labels can be given internal identifiers. The syntax is [label]{#identifier}. In the list below, A1ref, A2ref and Cref identify the item: * [**A1**]{#A1ref} This is the first claim. * [A2]{#A2ref} This is the second claim. * [*C*]{#Cref} This is the conclusion. Note that # is not part of the identifier. Identifiers should start with a letter and contain only letters, digits, colons :, dots ., dashes - and underscores _. Labels with identifiers can be crossreferenced using Pandoc’s citations or internal links. 16.5.4.2.1 Cross-referencing with citations The basic syntax is: Reference in text: @A1ref. Outputs the label with its formatting: A1. Normal reference: [@A1ref]. Outputs the label with its formatting, in parentheses: (A1). A prefix and suffix can be specified too: [remember @A1ref and the like] will output (remember A1 and the like). The suppressed author style, [-@A1ref], will be processed as normal reference You can crossrefer to several custom labels at a time: [@A1ref; @A2ref]. But mixing references to a custom label with bibliographic ones in a same citation won’t work: if Smith2003 is a key in your bibliography [@A1ref; Smith2003] will only output “((A1ref?); Smith, 2003)”. Because this syntax overlaps with Pandoc’s citation syntax, conflicts should be avoided: Avoid giving the same identifier (e.g. Smith2005) to a custom label item and a bibliographic entry. If that happens, the citation will be interpreted as crossreference to the custom label item. To make sure you you may use identifiers starting with item:: item:A1ref, item:A2ref, or some other prefix. The filter should preferably be run before citeproc, and before other filters that use citations (like pandoc-crossref). It may work properly even if it is run after, though citeproc will issue “citations not found” warnings. To ensure that the filter is run before, just place it before in the command line or in your YAML options file’s filters field. Alternatively, the citation syntax for crossreferencing custom label items can be deactivated. See [Customization] below. 16.5.4.2.2 Cross-referencing with internal links In Pandoc markdown internal links are created with the syntax [link text](#target_identifier). (Note the rounded brackets instead of curly ones for Span element identifiers.) You can use internal links to cross-refer to custom label items that have a identifier. If your link has no text, the label with its formatting will be printed out; otherwise whichever text you give for the link. For instance, given the custom label list above, the following: The claim [](#A1ref) together with [the next claim](#A2ref) entail ([](#Cref)). will output: The claim A1 together with the next claim entail (C). where the links point to the corresponding items in the list. 16.5.5 Custom-labelled lists within a numbered example list Requires: labelled-lists.lua, statement.lua. In some cases we wanted to put a custom-labelled list within a numbered example list. This is particularly difficult when we don’t want any content in the numbered example item other than the embedded list itself. Solution: place the embedded list within a statement. Note that the embedded content must be indented exactly twice (4 spaces). This works: (@example-Batu) ::: statement * []{delimiter=none} Every head of a horse is a head of an animal. * [&amp;there4;]{} Batu is a head of an animal. :::: You should reduce the right margin for the LaTeX output. (LaTeX experts: the statement is placed in a minipage whose with is that of the text minus the default list label width; this is typically too large for an embedded list.) (@Allskunksaremammals) ::: statement * []{} All skunks are mammals. `\\addtolength{\\rightskip}{1em} % fix needed`{=latex} * [&amp;there4;]{} All who fear all who respect all skunks fear all who respect all mammals. ::: 16.6 Crossreferencing and captioning tables, figures, images, equations Requires: the pandoc-crossref filter. Tables, images can be cross-referenced and can be given a coption text. To cross-reference an image: ![](imagefile.png) {#fig:my-image} As you can see in @Fig:my-image ... To add a caption to the image: ![An image of a flying pig](imagefile.png) {#fig:my-image} As you can see in @Fig:my-image ... Example with a table: As the reader can see in @tbl:diffstyles, there are many options: +----------+-----------+ | style | features | +==========+===========+ | ... | ... | +----------+-----------+ : The different styles of text {#tbl:diffstyles} The identifiers of images or figures must have the form #fig:..., those of tables #tbl:..., those of equations #eq:.... When crossreferencing them we use citation syntax with the prefixed identifiers: [@fig:my-image], @tbl:my-table, etc. This will print “figure 1”, “table 2”, etc. To get “Figure 1”, “Table 2” you capitalize the prefix: @Fig:..., @Tbl:.... Details are in the Pandoc-cross-ref documentation here. 16.7 Tables 16.7.1 Basic table syntax There are three formats to encode tables in pandoc’s markdown (‘simple’, ‘grid’ and ‘pipe’). Some are easier to type, some easier to read, some give more functionality (i.e. having several lines in a cell). The easiest way to create a table is to use RStudio’s visual editor. The editor allows you to create multiline cells, resize the columns a bit and so on. Alternatively, you can write tables in the markdown code. An online markdown table generator can help. For tables with large cells (a lot of text in the cell), you might need to expand the “wrap line size” for the RStudio editor. The visual editor ensures that your markdown files has lines of a certain length. These don’t matter to the final PDF / html output, but they make your markdown source more readable. Now when you have a large table, you might need a bit more horizontal space in the markdown. For that you increase the wrap line size for the editor. In your file metadata block: editor_options: markdown: wrap: 72 Replace 72 with e.g. 80 or more if needed. You’ll see the difference if you go to the visual editor and expand your table’s columns a bit. In the markdown, words in tables should not be cut. If your markdown table is like this: +-----+-------+ |know |valua- | |ledge|tion | +=====+=======+ |... |... | +-----+-------+ Then “knowledge” and “valuation” will print as “know ledge” and “valua- tion” respectively. You need to ensure that no word is cut by enlarging your table: +----------+-----------+ |knowledge | valuation | +==========+===========+ | ... | ... | +----------+-----------+ Tables found in your document will be turned into that format if their cells require multiple lines. Otherwise they will be turned into the simpler format: Corner Header 1 Header 2 Header 3 -------- ----------- ----------- ------------- Row 1 Hello My Friend Row 2 1asdoi 23 234 You can create tables from scratch (a) in the RStudio visual editor or (b) in markdown code. For the latter you can use a online markdown table generator. 16.7.2 Cells that span several rows or several columns Unfortunately this is not feasible in pandoc’s markdown, though that should change in the near future.10 Solution. Enter your table with all cells, and put the content of any merged area in the top left cell of the merged area. For example, the table below: Example missing, to be entered in raw HTML | Cells merged across a row | Head 1 | Head 2 | |:--------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-------| | | more | less | | Row head | Cells merged across a column | | Should be entered as if it was the table below: Example flawed, to be fixed | Cells merged across a row | Head 1 | Head 2 | |:--------------------------|:-----------------------------|:-------| | | more | less | | Row head | Cells merged across a column | | A note should be made of the change. Next to the table code you should enter the following: &lt;!-- cells to merge: C1R1 and C1R2; C2R3 and C3R3 --\\&gt; This will be invisible in the output, but visible to those who edit the file. ‘C2R3’ abbreviates ’second column from the left, third row the top. We will then have to insert LaTeX and HTML output code directly. See [if-markdown-cant-handle-a-table] below. 16.7.3 If markdown can’t handle a table Requires: the not-in-format filter. The instructions using Divs with not-in-format class below require the not-in-format filter. In case the usual markdown code for a table doesn’t work, we can insert a set of LaTeX code to the markdown file. The goal is then to have a set of latex code that can be inserted into the articles markdown file and then be run the usual way. For that, there are three steps needed: get the latex code for the desired table make the table look as desired get the code into the markdown file. Generate a separate markdown file (in the following called “separate .md”, whereas the initial markdown file of the article is called “articles .md”). Here we want to put only the latex code that will be inserted into the articles .md. For the first step (get the latex code for the desired table), there are two options: Build the latex code from scratch or via the table generator for latex, put the code to the separate .md. Build the markdown code from scratch or via the table generator for markdown, put it to the separate .md, let it produce a latex output, copy/paste the latex code to the separate .md (it probably begins with something like “ ” or “\\end{table}”). Once you have the latex code in the separate .md, you can embed it in the following code: ```{=latex} \\begin{center} [latex code for tables] \\end{center} ``` The \\begin{center} and \\end{center} lines are optional, their effet is to center your table in the page. The LaTeX code will only produce a result in LaTeX/PDF output. If the markdown code works with HTML output, you should leave it and embed it in a ::: {.not-in-format .latex} ... ::: Div, which ensures that the markdown table code is used only in formats other than LaTeX. ```{=latex} \\begin{center} [latex code for your table] \\end{center} ``` ::: {.not-in-format .latex} [markdown code for your table] ::: Check how the tables look by producing pdfs from the separate .md (much faster than always producing the whole article). From here, you might have or want to change several things: “longtable” -&gt; “tabular” (so that it doesn’t rely on longtable package, which doesn’t work within multicolumn environments). “”, “” and “” -&gt; “” for simple horizontal lines If a vertical line is desired at some point in the table change latex code \\begin{tabular}[]{@{}lcccc@{}} to \\begin{tabular}[]{@{}c|cccc@{}}. See that the number of letters determines the number of columns in the table. The letter “l” in the former code is to change into a “c” in the latter. To have a vertical line after the first column from the left, insert the sign (not letter!) “|” after the first c from the left. Once that frame is set, we can insert the code from the separate .md into the articles .md and see how it produces the tables from here. You may need to do the same to insert HTML code. In that case you should still leave the original markdown for other formats (JATS-XML), using not-in-format again: ```{=latex} [latex code for your table] ``` ```{=html} [html code for your table] ``` ::: {.not-in-format .latex .html} [markdown code for your table] ::: 16.7.4 Table aptions Requires: pandoc-crossref. If your table is in markdown only, add a caption thus: +----------+-----------+ |knowledge | valuation | +==========+===========+ | ... | ... | +----------+-----------+ : An analysis of knowledge and valuation {#tbl:K-and-V} The optional {#tbl:...} provides an identifier for crossreferences: As you can see in @tbl:K-and-V, the analysis... For further details on how to cite see the pandoc-crossref manual. If your table is in raw LaTeX and markdown, the solution is this: ::: {.not-in-format .latex } +----------+-----------+ |knowledge | valuation | +==========+===========+ | ... | ... | +----------+-----------+ : An analysis of knowledge and valuation {#tbl:K-and-V} ::: ::: {.not-in-format .latex} 16.8 Figures (images, diagrams, graphs) Figures are images, diagrams, graphs and the like. They can be inline or floated or annexed. inline: the figure needs to be at a precise point in the text. E.g. “As can be seen in the image below:”, followed by the image, followed by “a triangle can be split into two right triangles”. floated: the figure needs to be around a certain point in the text. It can be moved above, below, to the next or previous page, for better appearance. On a webpage, it can shown on the side of the text. Floated images annexed: the figure is placed at the end of the article. On a webpage, it can be shown on the side of the text. Figures can be provided in two ways: Separate files. Code in markdown or Rmarkdown that generates the figure (particularly good for graphs). At the moment the Dialectica house template only handles figures as files, so we’ll ignore the code option. 16.8.0.1 Inserting figures as files Basic syntax: ![caption](file.svg &#39;title of the image&#39;){... attributes ..} Where: file.svg is the source file caption is the text that will appear as the image’s caption if the image is treated as a floated. As can be seen in the image below: ![] &quot;, followed by the image, followed by &quot;a triangle can be split into two right triangles 16.8.1 Prefer vector formats for figures Diagrams, figures and the like should be provided in vector graphics formats (SVG files or code or TikZ code in LaTeX). Only photos, hand-drawn illustrations and the like should be provided as bitmap (a.k.a. raster) files. If you’re not familiar with the difference, see the explanation below. If an author provides a diagram in bitmap form we ask that they recreated it in a vector format. Inkscape is an open-source, free software to generate vector images that is fairly easy to use and powerful. Authors who write in LaTeX may try to create in using the TikZ package instead. 16.8.2 Background on vector vs bitmap formats (Skip this section if you are familiar with the distinction). What’s the difference between vector and bitmap image files? Bitmap (a.k.a. raster) images are encoded as a grid of pixels. Vector images are encoded as mathematical descriptions of lines and curves. For instance, a vector image may be (the computer-language equivalent of) “draw a circle of radius 10mm around the coordi nate (0,0).” The bitmap equivalent would be a big grid with cells coloured to form a circle. Because of this, vector images scale perfectly and magnify perfectly. Bitmap images can get noisy and pixelated when scaled or magnified. See below if you can tell which is which: knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;images/vectorVSbitmap-vector.svg&quot;)) knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;images/vectorVSbitmap-bitmap.png&quot;)) As you can see, the vector (first one) looks smooth when magnified, the bitmap looks pixelated. Why use vector images for diagrams? They’re much better quality and use much less space. A bitmap diagram easily looks pixelated in print or on a high-resolution screen; it’ll look unprofessional to the reader. Bitmaps in high resolution can look good even in print or when enlarged on a screen, but at the cost of using a lot of space: a 1920*1080 high resolution bitmap easily takes about 1000 times the space of vector version of the same diagram; an article with bitmap images can easily occupy the same space as 10 to 100 articles without. It’s only in the case of highly textured images (e.g. photos) that a vector version would be either impossible or much heavier than a bitmap. Which file types are vector, which are bitmap? JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIFF: bitmap images. PDF: can be bitmap, vector, and even images combining the two. The only way to tell is to zoom in a lot and see whether the lines remain perfect (vector) or pixelate (bitmap). File size is also an indicator: vectors are hardly more than a few Kbs, bitmaps can be anything from a few Kbs to one Mb or so. SVG: vector. Exception: an SVG file can import bitmaps from other files, including by URL. So in principle an author could send you a SVG ‘conversion’ that is nothing else than a link to an online version of their image. You’re very unlikely to encounter that problem, but if in doubt: the SVG file is a text file, you can open it in a text editor. Look for the tag &lt;image , e.g. &lt;image href=\"mybitmap.pgn\" width=\"200px\"/&gt;. How to convert a bitmap image to a vector image? It can’t really be done. The problem is that the computer has to guess from the pixel grid of a bitmap image what’s supposed to be a line, a curve, etc. and that requires some intelligence (think of it like this: we’re going from a limited resolution to infinite precision). This is called vectorizing the bitmap image. Software like Inkscape can try and vectorize images for you, but you have to fiddle with the settings for each specific image, and the results are rarely satisfactory. In most cases, your or the author will have a much easier time recreating the image in vector mode. If you want to try to vectorize anyway, search “vectorize an image in Inkscape” or “convert an image to SVG” online to find some tutorials. 16.8.3 How to create a vector image? How to create a vector image? Draw it in an editor, or code it in TikZ. Drawing in a vector graphics editor. Wikipedia has a [list of visual graphics editor]. Fully-featured editors will cover all needs but may require more work. Inkscape is the best open-source one; Adobe Illustrator a good propertary one. However for simple diagrams you may be able to get by with a quick-and-dirty online editor. There are quite a few of those; try online svg editor in a search engine (check whether you need to pay to save your file). At the moment DrawSVG seems good (easy to use, free and no registration, ads). TikZ diagrams. TikZ is a language to describe vector images that can be embedded in LaTeX. It’s powerful but has a very steep learning curve. If authors can provide them, TikZ diagrams are the best - because any text in those diagrams will be printed out in the journal’s own fonts. TikZ code can be included directly in the markdown. Our template will include them directly in the LaTeX/PDF output and convert them to SVG files for other output formats. How to create a TikZ diagram? Typically the author needs to go through the (large) TikZ documentation and work from existing examples. But there is also an online visual editor (TikZit) that can help. 16.8.3.1 How to modify a bitmap image Wikipedia has a list of bitmap image editors. GIMP is the best open-source editor. Adobe Photoshop and Photoshop Elements is a good commercial one, photography-oriented. 16.8.4 Figures with letters or text Figures often include letters or text. They look best if their fonts are consistent throughout your journal. It is desirable, but not mandatory, your house template fonts. If these can be freely distributed you could ask authors to install them and use them, but that’s a tall order. It’ll typically fall on you to apply house fonts if possible. Figures in TikZ code: automatic. TikZ specifies the text, not the fonts, so your house template will render the figures with your house fonts. Figures in SVG. Use a good editor like Inkscape with the house fonts installed on your computer. Open the file, select text elements, change their font. It should be quick. Exception: in some rare cases, the original files may have encoded the characters as complicated lines rather than characters proper; if so the editor won’t recognize them as text and change their font. If so your only option would be to remove the original text and recreate it: it is probably more time-costly than it’s worth. Figures in bitmap format: can’t realistically be done. Editing in a bitmap editor is possible but probably more time-costly than it’s worth. If you’re settling for a bitmap you’re already tolerating low quality anyway. 16.8.5 Resizing SVG files If the author provides you with a SVG file that has too much whitespace around, resize it using Inkscape. open the file in Inkscape select all the content with the arrow tool (click on the top left, drag your mouse to form a rectangle around it). Note: you could try Edit &gt; Select all (Ctrl+A on Win, Cmd+A on MacOS) but this sometimes take the entire page, even if it has a lot of whitespace. Go to File &gt; Document Properties. In the “Custom Size” area, expand the “Resize page to content…” line. Make sure “Units” is “px” (pixels). Enter 20 (20.00000) margins everywhere. If you activate the lock icon, you only need to enter 20 in one of the margins and the others will be the same. Click “Resize page to drawing or selection”. You should see that the page limits are just around the drawing. Close the “Document properties” box and save the document. 16.8.6 Including SVG image files in markdown If you insert an SVG image file in markdown and generate a PDF output, Pandoc needs to convert it to a format that LaTeX understands. It does so using an external programme, rsvg-convert. If rsvg-convert is not present, you will get a warning: [WARNING] Could not convert image...: check that rsvg-convert is in path. Solutions Convert the SVG files to PDF using Inkscape. They will still be vector file and print out well, but the LaTeX engine that generates your PDF output will be able to insert them. Open the file(s) in Inkscape, go to File &gt; Save a copy, select the “Portable Document Format (pdf)” format, save. In your markdown code replace ImageFile.svg with ImageFile.pdf. Install rsvg-convert. As far as we can tell the least difficult way to do this is to use package managers. On Linux look for rsvg-convert in your package manager. On MacOS you should install homebrew first, if you haven’t already, and run the command brew install rsvg-convert. On Win you should install the chocolatey package manager, open an administrator Powershell (Windows menu &gt; Windows Powersheel &gt; right click on Powershell and select “Run as Administrator”, give the permission) and run the command choco install rsvg-convert. Note: on Windows Pandoc 2.14.0.3 (June 2021 version) cannot handle SVG conversion, even if rsvg-convert is installed. If that’s your setup use the first solution. 16.9 Equations For the basics of formulas, see Formulas. 16.9.1 Numbered equations Requires: pandoc-crossref filter. Display formulas can be numbered by assigning them an identifier: $$E = mc^2$$ {#eq:my-label} Here the identifier is eq:my-label. It must start with eq:. It can then be used for crossreferences: As shown by @my-label, ... The syntax for crossreferences is like that of citations, but it can also automatically add a prefix like ‘Eq.’ or ‘Eqs.’. See the pandoc-crossref documentation. 16.10 Theorems and proofs Requires: the statement.lua filter. We format them as “fenced Div blocks”, i.e. blocks separated by three or more colons (the closing fence must have as many as the opening one). The fenced Div must have a class from one of the default theorem types like theorem (or thm), proposition (or prop), lemma (or lem), definition (or defn), remark (or rmk), etc. ::: theorem Content of the theorem Second paragraph of the same theorem. ::: An theorem can have an id for cross-reference. If you add an ID don’t forget the curly brackets and point before theorem: ::: {.theorem #theorem} Content of the theorem ::: Theorems can also have a source, or some info. The source is a citation right at the beginning of the theorem: ::: theorem @jones1990 Content of the theorem ::: Info is some text between brackets at the beginning of the theorem. The text can itself contain brackets, provided they’re properly balanced: ::: theorem (negative (or positive) values) Content of the theorem ::: Proofs: ::: proof Obvious from theorem @mytheorem. ::: 16.10.1 Statements in footnotes Statement environments don’t work in footnote for LaTeX/PDF outputs. This 16.11 Natural deduction proofs with bussproofs If an article uses the LaTeX bussproofs package, the following guidelines will allow them to be displayed directly in HTML when using the Mathjax option.11 Bussproofs can be either inline, ending with \\DisplayProof: \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$)} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\DisplayProof Or display (block element), within a prooftree environment: \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$)} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree} 16.11.1 Inline bussproofs Mathjax does not display inline bussproofs. So prefer display ones wherever possible. Still, if you must use an inline one, doing the following ensures that in HTML output the reader see a simple error message in red where the proof would have been. If you don’t follow them, you’re likely to get a messy output. Enclose the proof within $...$: $\\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$)} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\DisplayProof$ If you don’t, Pandoc does not output anything at all where the proof would have been. Replace all the $...$ with the proof’s formulas with \\(...\\): $\\AxiomC{\\(P \\land Q\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(Q\\)} \\DisplayProof$ If you don’t, the HTML output will display a confusing mix of LaTeX code and error message, such as: \\(\\AxiomC{\\)A\\(}\\UnaryInfC{\\)AExtra close brace or missing open 16.11.2 Prooftree environments Requires: the not-in-format filter. (Note: the problem below will be fixed with Pandoc 2.19.3. With this update we should be able to enter the prooftree environments without the surrounding $$..$$. (to be tested).) With prooftree environments we face the following problem: If we include the LaTeX directly in the source, it’s not printed at all in HTML output: \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{\\(P \\land Q\\)} \\UnaryInfC{\\(Q\\)} \\end{prooftree} If we enclose it within `$$...$$, it is passed to the HTML output and then correctly displayed by MathJax. But the PDF generation crashes. $$\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree}$$ Solution. We provide two versions of the prootree environment, one for formats other than LaTeX, one for LaTeX. This is done as follows: ::: {.not-in-format .latex} $$\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree}$$ ::: ::: {.only-in-format .latex} \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree} ::: Within prooftree environements there’s no need to replace the $...$ with \\(...\\). The not-in-format and only-in-format Divs can contain any markdown content, including a mix of LaTeX and markdown if needed. For isntance, your proofs may be in numbered example lists: ::: {.not-in-format .latex} (@) $$\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree}$$ ::: ::: {.only-in-format .latex} (@) \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree} ::: And if you have several proofs in a row, you don’t need to have two Divs for each, you can have two Divs overall: ::: {.not-in-format .latex} 1. $$\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree}$$ 2. $$\\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P$} \\UnaryInfC{$P\\lor Q$} \\end{prooftree}$$ ::: ::: {.only-in-format .latex} 1. \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P \\land Q$} \\UnaryInfC{$Q$} \\end{prooftree} 2. \\begin{prooftree} \\AxiomC{$P$} \\UnaryInfC{$P\\lor Q$} \\end{prooftree} ::: 16.12 Statements and indented blocks Requires: the statement.lua filter. Special blocks that appear as indented fall into three types: quotations: bits of text from another source. equations: bits of text that are entirely (or mostly) symbols. Example: \\(A = \\{ x \\in \\Omega: x \\textrm{ is even}\\}\\) statements: theorems, proofs, examples, cases (a story that illustrates a problem), vignettes (a story given to subjects in an experiment) and the like. For theorems and proofs see above. This sections deals with statements otherthan theorems. We format statements as ‘fenced Divs’ with the statement class. A fenced Div is texted enclosed by “fences” of three or more colons: ::: statement The sum of angles of a triangle equals two right angles. ::: ::: statement ::::: The sum of angles of a triangle equals two right angles. ::::::::::::::::::: These will be printed as simple indented blocks. The closing face must have at least as many columns as the starting one. The statement here makes it a element of the statement class (i.e., type). The class can also be specified thus (note the dot .statement): ::: {.statement} The sum of angles of a triangle equals two right angles. ::: The curly brackets and the dot {. ... } are mandatory if the block as more features than statement, e.g. a ID for crossreference or some other class (some examples below). If you want to specify the type of statement (say, because you want to distinguish axioms from theorems), you need to use curly brackets: ::: {.statement .axiom} Between any two distinct points there is a straight line. ::: Because we have two properties (statement and axiom), the curly brackets are mandatory: here ::: statement axiom would not work. 16.12.1 Statement titles A statement can have a title (aka custom label). This is specified in Strong emphasis (**...** or __...__), at the beginning of the statement: ::: statement **The Principal Principle**. One&#39;s credence in $p$ conditional on the hypothesis that the chance of $p$ is $x$ should be $x$. ::: This will be rendered as an indented block with its title in the template’s preferred formatting of statement titles, for instance: The Principal Principle. One’s credence in \\(p\\) conditional on the hypothesis that the chance of \\(p\\) is \\(x\\) should be \\(x\\). If you don’t specify an ID or acronym for the statement, its title is used to generate an ID automatically. The automatic ID is a lower case version, with all spaces and symbols replaced by _: the-principal-principle. If this ID already exists in your document (for instance, if it’s also the title of a section that Pandoc uses to automatically generate an ID for that section), the ID will be ...-1, or ...-2, as needed. A statement can only have one ID so if the statement has an acronym or custom ID (see below) they’re replace this one. 16.12.2 Statement acronyms If a statement has a title, you can also give it an acronym. It’s placed at the beginning of the title, within parentheses: ::: statement **(PP) The Principal Principle**. One&#39;s credence in $p$ conditional on the hypothesis that the chance of $p$ is $x$ should be $x$. ::: The result will depend on where the template prefers to place the acronym. For instance: The Principal Principle (PP). One’s credence in \\(p\\) conditional on the hypothesis that the chance of \\(p\\) is \\(x\\) should be \\(x\\). Beware that the acronym must be within the title, i.e. within the strong emphasis delimiters: GOOD: __(PP) The Principal Principle__ BAD: (PP) __The Principal Principle__ If you don’t specify an ID for a statement with an acronym, the acronym will be used to automatically generated an ID, e.g. PP. (When the ID PP already exists in your document, it’ll be PP-1 instead, or PP-2, etc.). 16.12.3 Statement info A statement can have some info, e.g. a source citation or some text within parentheses This is put at the end of, or right after, the statement’s title. ::: statement **(Acro) Title of the satement (some info).** Content of the statement ::: ::: statement **(Acro) Title of the satement @Doe2020.** Content of the statement ::: ::: statement **(Acro) Title of the satement.** (some info) Content of the statement ::: ::: statement **(Acro) Title of the satement.** @Doe2020 Content of the statement ::: If there’s no title, the info is just at the beginning. ::: statement (some info) Content of the statement ::: ::: statement @Doe2020 [@Doe2021; @Doe2022] Content of the statement ::: The output depends on the template. (The template may even define different styles for different kinds of statement.) It may look like this, for instance: The Principal Principle (PP). (Lewis (1990)) One’s credence in \\(p\\) conditional on the hypothesis that the chance of \\(p\\) is \\(x\\) should be \\(x\\). 16.12.4 Statement custom IDs You can cross-reference statements that have an ID If the statement has an acronym or title, you can use the ID automatically generated based on those. Otherwise you can give it an ID by putting a #myidentifier entry in its attributes: ::: {.statement #my-favourite-statement} __Title of the statement__. Content of the statement ::: It’s good practice to start your ID by sta: to make clear that it’s a statement ID: ::: {.statement #sta:psr} __(PSR) Principle of Sufficient Reason__. Content of the statement ::: Beware of adding curly brackets and a dot before statement: GOOD ::: {.statement #my-favourite-statement} ... ::: BAD ::: statement #my-fav-statement ... ::: ::: {statement #my-fav-statement} ... ::: A statement can only have one ID so if you provide one you can’t refer to it by its acronym or title. 16.12.5 Statement within a numbered example list See custom-labelled lists within numbered example lists. 16.12.6 Crossreferencing statements Statements with ID (either automatically generated from their title or acronym, if any, or custom IDs that you provide) can be crossreferenced. You can use the citation syntax or the link syntax. 16.12.6.1 Citation syntax @mystatement will produce a link with the statement acronym if it has one: PP, otherwise a link its title if has one: The Principal Principle or nothing. [@mystatement] will produce the same as above, surrounding by bracket. Beware that if your statement has no title or acronym (and it’s not a numbered statement e.g. theorem) you’ll only get two parentheses: (). Citations of multiple statements produce a ;-separated list. [@sta:psr, @sta:pp] can produce ‘(Principle of Sufficient Reason; Principal Principle)’ for instance. citation prefixes and suffixes are allowed: [See @sta:pp above]. 16.12.6.2 Link syntax [](#mystatement) will produce the same as @mystatement. `arbitrary text will produce “[arbitrary text]” with a link to the statement. Within the link text, &lt;&gt; will be replaced the statement’s automatic label, i.e. its acronym (it is has one) or title. See the [principle &lt;&gt;]{#sta:pp} above. This will produce: ‘See the principle PP’ if the statement @sta:pp has acronym PP. The link syntax can’t be used to refer multiple statements. But it gives you more control over how the link is formatted. Compare: * According to principle @sta:pp, ... * According to [principle &lt;&gt;]{#sta:pp}, ... The former generates a small link: ‘according to principle PP’, the latter a longer one: ‘according to principle PP’. 16.13 Arguments Requires: the labelled-lists.lua filter. We format arguments as custom labelled lists. To indicate the the conclusion, the last label is &amp;there4;, i.e. the symbol ∴. * [1]{} No man is wise. * [2]{} Socrates is a man. * [C]{} Socrates is not wise. Here 1, 2, C are custom labels. We can also write an argument without labels, but we should then add the option deliminter=none to the first item in order to avoid empty parentheses: * []{delimiter=none} No man is wise. * []{} Socrates is a man. * [there4;]{} Socrates is not wise. &amp;there4 is the standard ‘therefore’ sign (three dots). The delimiter=none option can be set in the document metadata. It will then apply to all custom labelled lists in the document unless specified otherwise in the lists themselves. See custom labelled lists. As explained in custom labelled lists, crossreference links to premises can be done by giving them identifiers and using the citation syntax: * [1]{#prem1} No man is wise. * [2]{#prem2} Socrates is a man. * [C]{#conc} Socrates is not wise. Premises @prem1 and @prem2 entail @conc. Requires: the statement.lua filter. Arguments can be placed within statements, especially if they have a name. ::: statement __The ontological argument__ * []{delimiter=none} * []{} ::: To place an argument within a numbered example list, see custom-labelled lists within numbered example lists. 16.14 Multiple columns Requires: the columns filter. This is about setting parts of text in multiple columns, not about typesetting an entire document in two columns. It is sometimes useful to typset a part of text into multiple columns, e.g. to display some claims or formulas side by side. Note that this is not the same as using a table. Here we just divide part of the text into two or more columns, and the text may be allowed to flow from one to the other. The syntax is this: ::: columns :::: column This goes in the first column :::: :::: column This goes in the second column :::: :::: column This goes in a third column :::: ::: In LaTeX, columns are justified vertically by default. That is, if columns are explicitly broken at certain points, LaTeX ensures that the text in each column occupies its full height by stretching inter-paragraph space. This means that some paragraph may end up being “bumped” at the end of a column. To avoid this, set the .ragged class on your columns Div like so: ::: {.columns .ragged} ... ::: Note that this doesn’t work on individual column Divs, only on the columns Div that contains them. Above I use three colons to open and close the “columns” part, and four colons to open and close each “column”. Any number above two works, provided they are distinct from each other. Good Bad Columns opens and closes with 3 colons, each column opens and closes with 5: ::: {.columns} ::::: {.column} On the left ::::: ::::: {.column} On the right ::::: ::: Everything opens and closes with 4 colons: :::: {.columns} :::: {.column} On the left :::: :::: {.column} On the right :::: :::: First column opens and closes with 5 colons, second with 7: ::: {.columns} ::::: {.column} On the left ::::: ::::::: {.column} On the right ::::::: ::: ``` First column opens with 5 but closes with 7, second column opens with 7 but closes with 5: ::: {.columns} ::::: {.column} On the left :::::::: ::::::: {.column} On the right ::::: ::: The {. … } is optional if you have one word only, but mandatory if you have several ::: {.columns} ::: {.column} On the left ::: ::: {.column} On the right ::: ::: ::: {.columns \\#my-columns} ::: {.column} On the left ::: ::: {.column} On the right ::: ::: ::: columns \\#my-columns ::::: column width=&quot;40%&quot; On the left ::::: ::::::: column label=&quot;red&quot; On the right ::::::: ::: At present you cannot set the relative width of columns. See columns filter manual for further details. 16.15 Raw code if all else fails Requirement. The not-in-format filter is required for some of the below. When there is no markdown solution to typeset something there is fallback solution: include raw output code of other formats directly in your markdown document. We first figure out how the element should be coded in relevant output formats (LaTeX, html, xml); we call this raw code. Then we insert raw code without our markdown document. In some cases you’re happy with the output markdown generates in some, but not all, formats. For instance, the XML output is fine (XML has no typesetting), but you’d like to do some fine-grained typesetting in LaTeX that the normal LaTeX output doesn’t handle. In that case you’ll use markdown for some output formats, but provide raw code only for LaTeX. To provide Raw code for all output formats, you insert it as follows: ``` {=latex} ... LaTeX code here ... ``` ``` {=html} ... html/epub code here ... ``` ``` {=xml} ... xml code here ... ``` The part marked with {=latex} will be included as is in the LaTeX output (for PDFs) and only in the LaTeX output. To provide raw code for some, but not all, formats, you should put the relevant bits of markdown within a not-in-format div, and the raw code after it. (This method requires the not-in-format Pandoc filter.) For instance: ::: {.not-in-format .latex} -------- ------- simple table -------- ------- ::: ```{=latex} \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{ll} \\hline simple &amp; table \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} ``` Here the simple markdown table enclosed within :::{.not-in-format .latex} … ::: will be used for all outputs formats except LaTeX and LaTeX-based outputs like PDF and beamer. The raw code below included within ```{=latex} … ``` will be used for LaTeX and LaTeX-based outputs. You can leave out some markdown section from several formats too: :::{.not-in-format .xml .latex}. References "],["cross-referencing.html", "Chapter 17 Cross-referencing 17.1 Cross-referencing sections 17.2 Cross-referencing footnotes 17.3 Cross-referencing list items 17.4 Internal links", " Chapter 17 Cross-referencing When an article cross-references its own sections, figures, tables, images, numbered examples, equations and footnotes, we encode these in markdown. This ensures that they are linked (and, in some case, standardly labelled and properly numbered) in the outputs. Cross-references to sections, figure, tables, images are handled by the pandoc-crossref extension of pandoc. We describe its basic usage described below (full documentation here). Cross-references to numbered examples is handled by pandoc itself, usage described below. At the moment we cannot handle neatly cross-references to footnotes. A workaround is given below. 17.1 Cross-referencing sections To cross-reference a section you first need to know its identifier. pandoc accepts manually specified identifiers but also automatically generates identifiers. A manually specified identifiers is given by adding {#sec:mysecid} after the heading. An automatically generated identifier is obtained by putting the section heading in lowercase, removing all formatting, links, footnotes, removing all characters other than letters, numbers, underscore, periods and hyphens, and replacing spaces by hyphens. Some examples: Markdown heading Resulting section identifier(s) # The Last Stand the-last-stand ## Cause *célèbre*^[Sic.] cause-célèbre ## The no.1 'Foolish' Claim that $E=mc^2$ the-no.1-foolish-claim-that-emc2 # The First Word {#sec:first} first Special cases. If a heading starts with something else than a letter, everything before that letter is removed (to ensure that all identifiers start with a letter). If a heading is empty, its identifier is section. If there are several headings of the same name (say, section), the second one is suffixed with -1 (section-1) then -2, etc. Markdown headings Resulting section identifier(s) # 3 Little Pigs little-pigs # Surprise Party ## Surprise Party surprise-party surprise-party-1 # # section section-1 Warning: of course, if you change a section heading title, the automatically generated identifier changes. So if your headings might change, either use manual identifiers or wait before entering cross-references. When editing in RStudio visual mode, you can use Insert &gt; Cross-reference to find heading identifiers. A menu with the list of headings is displayed; pick the one you want and the editor will insert the code ??. Remove @ref(…), and enter @sec: right in front of the the-first-word. The code @sec:the-first-word should become blue as you type @ and the following letters; if not it’s not interpreted as a reference, try again or edit in code mode instead. Now to cross-reference sections with identifiers the-first-word, the-second-word, use the following code: I want I type In sec. 1, we review… In @sec:the-first-word, we review or In [@sec:the-first-word], we review Sec. 1 discusses @Sec:title-of-section discusses or [@Sec:title-of-section] discusses In secs. 1, 2 we In [@sec:the-first-word; @sec:the-second-word] we review … elsewhere (sec. 1). ...elsewhere (@sec:the-first-word). or ...elsewhere ([@sec:the-first-word]). Note that @Sec:… instead of @sec:… capitalizes the label. Note that the quare-bracketed version doesn’t add parentheses (unlike in citations): the square brackets are only necessary if you have several references or a manually specified prefix (below). The prefix (“sec.” here) is specified by the template. It can be suppressed or manually specified: I want I type as said above (1). as said above [-@sec:the-first-word] In unit 1, we… In [unit @sec:the-first-word] In § 1, we… In [§ @sec:the-first-word] In appendix 5, … In [appendix @sec:appendix-proof-of-theorems], ... In appendices 5, 6, … In [appendices @sec:app1; appendices @sec:app2] As the last line illustrates, you need to repeat the custom prefix to each entries that it applies to, even though in the output they will be grouped. Style recommendations. Call subsections “sections” when referencing to them. If you’re referencing a subsection, you should still call it “section” in the readable text: ``cf. section [@sec:asubsectionid]. A subsection is a section, and the terminology of “subsection” is clunky and technical. Avoid specifying a manual prefix just to follow the author’s style. The default prefix is specified in the journal’s style template and should be preferred wherever possible. A manual prefix is only recommended for appendices (or any other section that is not a regular section of the paper). “In the last section”, “In the next section”, …. What if the author references sections verbally, e.g.: “In the last section, we will summarize…”, or “The next section reviews …”? Two options, decide what fits best: make non-verbose: In @sec:the-last-one, we..., @Sec:the-next-one reviews ... add cross-references in brackets: In the last section ([@sec:the-last-one]), In the next section ([@sec:the-next-one]), .... The following does not work with PDF output, so we do not use it. It is also possible to specify a custom label to replace the number. This can be combined with a custom identifier: I want I type See appendix A… 12. Appendix A: Proofs See [appendix @sec:appendix-a-proofs]... # Appendix A: Proofs {label=\"A\"} See appendix A… 12. Appendix A: Proofs See [appendix @sec:app1]... # Appendix A: Proofs {label=\"A\" #sec:app1} 17.2 Cross-referencing footnotes Cross-reference to footnotes has to be done manually. If your footnote numbers are not final yet, you will need to revist them before publishing. We do not reference the page numbers where the footnote appears. This is meaningless in HTML and ePub output. The syntax is as follows: This is the main text.[^myfn] [^mfn]: [On this]{#my-best-footnote} difficult point I would like to add irrelevant remarks... . ... As mentioned above in [footnote 7](#my-best-footnote), ... [^myfn] and [myfn]: create a footnote. We could have the alternative syntax, ^[... content ...] placed directly in the text: This is the main text.^[[On this]{#my-best-footnote} difficult point... .] [On this]{#my-best-footnote} creates a “Span” element with the identifier my-best-footnote. A Span is an invisible inline element that can carry attributes such as an identifier. The identifier allows us to target it with a link. [footnote 1](#my-best-footnote) adds to the text “footnote 7” a clickable link to the span we create above. You need to enter the footnote number manually. Common mistake. Beware of not confusing the syntaxes for Span (targets) and Links: A Span uses curly brackets: [span]{#id} Links use parentheses: [link](#id) Syntax and placement of the target. The target Span can be empty: []{#my-footnote} It should be placed within the first line of the footnote, to ensure referencing links take the reader to that line. But **do not* place an empty Span right at the beginning of the foonote: in this position the Span leaves an unwanted blank space: BAD [^footnote]: []{#fn-point} On this difficult point GOOD [^footnote]: [On]{#fn-point} this difficult point GOOD [^footnote]: See @doe_j:2020.[]{#fn-doe} Non-final manuscripts. If footnote numbers are not final, you will need to update crossreferences to footnotes. A good practice is to use very visible text to ensure that you don’t miss them in proofing: See above [footnote NUMBER](#fn-doe). 17.3 Cross-referencing list items You have a numbered list and you want to cross-reference one of its items: first item section item third item. My favour item is (2), what’s yours? The solution is as with footnotes: you have to put an invisible link target in the item and you have to create a link to it. The number is manually entered in the link, not automatic, so you have to make sure you know which number it is. 1. first item 2. []{#myidentifier} section item 3. third item. My favour item is ([2](#myidentifier)), what&#39;s yours? Note the difference between the target, where the identifier is in curly braces, and the link, where the identifier is in parentheses: target: []{#myidentifier} link: [2](#myidentifier) 17.4 Internal links If you want a part of the text to link to another, say have a statement labelled “C1” and later parts referring to it as “(C1)”, use internal link syntax. The general syntax is: [text to be linked to]{#unique-identifier} ... [text that will become a link](#unique-identifier) Common error: leaving spaces between text and {\\#identifier}: BAD GOOD [text linked to] {#identifier} [linking text] (#identifier) [text linked to]{#identifier} [linking text](#identifier) Example: [Claim 1]{#my-claim}. Death is nothing to us. (... article goes on ...) As [my earlier claim](#my-claim) established, ... . This outputs, in both HTML and LaTeX : Claim 1. Death is nothing to us … As my earlier claim established, … Don’t worry about whether the link is coloured and/or underlined: that is to be decided by the journal style. Note that [text that will be linked] to and [text that will become a link] are printed as is. If you wanted to change all labels to “Claim 2”, for instance, you need to change both the text linked to and the text that becomes a link. Targets (also known as “anchors”) and links to them typically need some formatting. For instance, we may want our claim label in bold and the link to it to be the label itself in parentheses: [**C1**]{#my-new-claim}. Death is nothing to us. ... As ([C1](#my-new-claim)) established, ... . This outputs: C1. Death is nothing to us. … As (C1) established, … .

(See for instance Jones (2018)). Code: [See for instance, @Smith2015] Output: (See for instance Smith, 2015). Code: See f o r instance @Smith2012; @Smith2015. Output: See for instance Smith (2012); Smith (2015). Code: See for insta n ce Smith [-@Smith2012; @Smith2015] Output: See for instance Smith (2012, 2015). More details explained in pandoc’s markdown reference, citations section. 18.1.1 Ibid., Op. Cit., sec. or § and the like All the finer-grained formating is handled by the bibliography template. Whether repeated citations are printed out as “ibid”, “op. cit”, whether page ranges are referred to as “pp. 12-15” or “p. 12-15” or “12-15”, whether sections are called “sec.” or “§”, etc., all of this is decided and automatically handled by the bibliography template. If an author uses ibid. or op. cit., just replace it with the original citation. For instance, if the author’s manuscript has: Lewis (1986, 19) says something important. He adds something less interesting a few pages later (ibid., 29). We encode: @Lewis1986 [19] says something important. He adds something less interesting a few pages later [@Lewis1986, 29]. 18.1.2 Putting a citation link on a page number, or a word Citations must all be in one of the three forms above (Normal, Inline or Year-only). We cannot, and should not, put them on arbitrary words or page numbers. For instance, in the following: @Lewis1986 [19] says something important, but see also page 29. We could either turn “page 29” in an inline or year-only citation, or leave it without link—provided there’s already a link to the work nearby, as is the case above. 18.2 Examples with preferred answers 18.2.1 Example: Doe (2019, 2020) Original It should be noted here that, on the face of it, Doe (2019, 2020) does introduce his theory to justify placing greater weight on oneself than on others in making decisions. Proposed It should be noted here that, on the face of it, Doe (2020, 2019) does introduce his theory to justify placing greater weight on oneself than on others in making decisions. on the face of it, Doe [-@doe_j:2020; -@doe_j:2019] does introduce... Preferred Use the inline citation format. It should be noted here that, on the face of it, Jane Doe (2020, 2019) does introduce his theory to justify placing greater weight on oneself than on others in making decisions. on the face of it, @doe_j:2020 [@doe_j:2019] does introduce 18.2.2 Example: locating the possessive “’s” Original One example is Doe (2020)’s notion of the “personal horizon,” especially considering his discussion of “the truth in solipsism” and his insistence that “my” horizon is really “the” (preeminent) horizon. Proposal One example is Doe (2020)’s notion of the “personal horizon,” especially considering his discussion of “the truth in solipsism” and his insistence that “my” horizon is really “the” (preeminent) horizon. One example is Doe [-@doe_j:2020]&#39;s notion... Preferred Inline citations are simpler and give a better output link (clickable name as well as year): One example is Jane Doe (2020)’s notion… One example is @doe_j:2020&#39;s notion... But in the original, “Doe (2020)’s …” is bad typesetting. Better move the citation to the end of the sentence or attach the possessive to the author’s name: One example is Doe’s notion of the “personal horizon,” especially considering his discussion of “the truth in solipsism” and his insistence that “my” horizon is really “the” (preeminent) horizon [doe_j:2020]. “the” (preeminent) horizon [doe_j:2020]. One example is Doe’s [-doe_j:2020] notion… One example is Doe&#39;s [-doe_j:2020] notion... Both are fine, my favoured option is the first. 18.2.3 Example Original Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones (2017), and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith (2018)). Copyedited We would avoid the double parenthesis at the end. More generally, avoid parentheses when the references is in parentheses: Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018). But also, if we’re citing Jane Doe’s introduction to Smith (2018), we should have a bibliography entry for that chapter itself. So ultimately we want: (e.g., Jones, 2017, Doe 2018). Proposed First attempt, use two inline citations. But it results in a double parenthesis: Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones (2019), and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith (2018)). as much (e.g., @jones_j:2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018). Second attempt, make it a single parenthesis citation with two references, on the model (Jones 2019; Smith 2018) ([@jones_j:2017; @smith_j:2018]). But pandoc doesn’t see it as a citation and the phrase disappears: Others have granted him as much Smith (2018). as much [e.g., @jones_j:2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018]. What is going on? The syntax of inline citation separates prefixes and suffixes with commas (,) or spaces and different references with semi-colons (;). So the general rule is: if you have two keys you should have a semi-colon. In the code above what pandoc sees is: [prefix, @citekey, verylongsuffix] where verylongsuffix is the code and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018. But a suffix cannot include citations. It can only be simple text (and passim or a famous passage) or locator type + location (chap. 2, pages 12-13) or location (12-13). To avoid that, we must make “and Jane Doe in the introduction to” the prefix of the second citation, @smight_j:2018: Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones 2019; and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith 2018). as much [e.g., @jones_j:2017; and Jane Doe in the introduction to @smith_j:2018]. This is seen by pandoc as: [prefix, @jones_j:2017; anotherprefix @smith_j:2018]. Remark that we get ; rather than , in between the citations. Compare: Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017, and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018). Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones, 2017; and Jane Doe in the introduction to Smith, 2018). Some might prefer the first. But this is a small cost and one could argue that the second is more systematic. Preferred The preferred method is to cite Doe’s introduction to Smith (2018) as a reference in its own right: Others have granted him as much (e.g., Jones 2019; John Doe 2018). as much [e.g., @jones_j:2017; @doe_j:2018]. This requires an adding to the entry in the bibliography. The entry is a book section authored by Doe is a book authored (not edited) by Smith. Entering it in Zotero and exporting as Bibtex gives us the code: @inbook{doe_j:2018, author = {Doe, John}, title = {Introduction}, booktitle = {An imaginary book}, bookauthor = {Smith, John}, publisher = {Ideas Press}, address = {Mainville}, year = {2018} } References "],["bibliography-1.html", "Chapter 19 Bibliography 19.1 Get or create a BibTeX file 19.2 Make sure any self-cited entries are included and printed 19.3 Adding non-cited references in the bibliography 19.4 Inserting Citations in the text in RStudio 19.5 Formatting citations in the text 19.6 BibTeX file guidelines 19.7 BibTeX file special entry types 19.8 Troubleshooting and examples", " Chapter 19 Bibliography You should get or create a bibliography file contained the references cited in your manuscript. This could be a BibTeX file (.bib) or a CSL json file (usually .json). You need to: Get or create a bibliography file Check whether the file includes any self-cited entries. Some bibliography entries may cite other entries, so the bibliography file will cite its own entries. We need to ensure that any such self-cited entry is actually present in the file, and we need to ensure that it is printed out in the bibliography. dialectica. We use BibTeX files. The “bibliography file” below refers to a .bib file in your article’s folder. 19.1 Get or create a BibTeX file Temporary solution: get your .bib from Philipp. 19.2 Make sure any self-cited entries are included and printed Your bibliography file may be ‘self-citing’, that is it may include some entries that cite other entries. For instance, a bibliography entry may have the title “Review of \\citet{Smith_h:2005}”, where the latter is LaTeX code to cite the entry with key Smith_h:2005. If your bibliography file might have such entries you need to do two things: Make sure that for all the self-cited keys, there is an entry in the file. Make sure that the self-cited keys are printed out in the final bibliography. If somebody else is taking care of your bibliography file, you only have to do the second. If in addition you’re sure that your bibliography file does not include unnecessary entries, you have a simple way of dealing with (2) by adding the nocite: @* line in your metadata. See below. 19.2.1 Check that the BibTeX file includes all self-cited entries Requires: Dialectica’s selfcites.py script. Using the terminal. The problem. If a bibliography file self-cites some keys, but doesn’t include an entry for these keys, you will get “Missing reference” warnings and your bibliography will be incomplete. You need to ensure that there’s an entry for any self-cited key. Solution. Run the selfcites.py script on your bibliography file. Suppose your article’s bibliography file is named myreferences.bib. Open a terminal, navigate to the article folder and run: python3 ../../../resources/scripts/selfcites.py myreferences.bib More generally, you can run that script from anywhere on a bib file that is anywhere: python3 path/to//selfcites.py path/to/myreferences.bib The script will check the .bib file for self-citations and output a report in the terminal such as: Dialectica open access initative self-citing bibliography file check, (c) Thomas Hodgson 2021 I found these self cited keys: quine:1951e, loux:1970, lewis_dk:2001c, vaninwagen:2001, quine:1953, lewis_dk:1983 These self cited keys are missing from the file&#39;s entries: quine:1951e loux:1970 lewis_dk:2001c vaninwagen:2001 quine:1953 lewis_dk:1983 For information, these are all the entries I found: horgan_te-potrc:2008, brenner_and:2017a, zimmerman_dw:2008, kleinschmidt_s:2014, sider_t:2013, rettler:2016, vaninwagen:1998d, cameron_rp:2012, lewis_dk:1973, cowling_s:2013b, finocchiaro_p:2019:, burgess_jp-rosen:1997, mcsweeney:2019, willard_mb:2014, bennett_k:2009, nolan_dp:1997b, tallant:2013a, schaffer_j:2015a, prior_an-fine:1977, turner_j:2015, churchland_pm:1984, finocchiaro_p:2021:, melia:2008a, quine:1948, torza:2015, schaffer_j:2009d, lewis_dk-lewis:1970, bennett_k-zimmerman:2013, linnebo-nicolas:2008, lewis_dk:1986, parsons_j:2014, chalmers_dj-etal:2009, sober:2015, sider_t:2011, merricks:2001, keller_ja:2017, finocchiaro_p:2019b:, mckay_tj:2006, paul_la:2017a If there are keys below “These self cited keys are missing from the file’s entries:”, then your .bib file cites these keys but they are missing. You need to add them. The line below “I found these self cited keys:” can be used to ensure the self-cited entries are printed in the article bibliography. See below. 19.2.2 Make sure all the self-cited entries are printed out The problem. If bibliography file self-cites some entries, but the manuscript itself doesn’t cite them, these entries will not be printed in the bibliography. The solution. The self-cited entries must be added in the document’s metadata, in a nocite field. There are two ways to do so: if you’re sure that your .bib file only contains entries that need to be printed out (no extra entries), then you can use the simple option 1. otherwise, use option 2, which requires a script. Option 1. If you are sure that your .bib file only contains entries that need to be printed out in the bibliography Requires: the selfcites.py script. See above. Open the .bib file in a text editor. Search for \\cite. If you have no no results, then your .bib file doesn’t include self-citations and you are good to go. If you do find results, you will have bibliography entries in the file that look like this, for instance: @book{geach_pt:1962, address = {Ithaca, New York}, author = {Geach, Peter Thomas}, note = {third edition: \\citet{geach_pt:1980}}, publisher = {Cornell University Press}, title = {Reference and Generality, an examination of some medieval and modern theories}, year = {1962}, } In the note = line here, you see the code \\citet{geach_pt:1980}. This is a LaTeX command that cites another bibliography entry in the same file, namely the one with the key geach_pt:1980. Ultimately this will be printed out in the bibliography as: Geach, Peter Thomas (1962) Reference and Generality, an Examination of Some Medieval and Modern Theories, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press. Thrid edition: Geach (1980). … Geach, Peter Thomas (1980) Reference and Generality, … The LaTeX \\cite commands can start with \\cite, \\citet, \\citep; you will find all of these by searching \\cite in the file. Sometimes the command cites pages numbers and looks like this instead: note = {reprinted in \\citet[232--258]{mccall_s:1967}, with considerable change in notation}, In that case the cited entry’s key is still the thing between curly brackets, here mccall_s:1967. Now you need to make sure that the self-cited entries appear in the bibliography. The problem is that if it is only cited in the bibligraphy and not the paper itself, it will not automatically be included. To ensure that it is included, you need to add the key in your document metadata, in a nocite field: title: A Neat Paper author: Smith, John bibliography: smith.bib nocite: | geach_pt:1980, mccall_s:1967 The nocite: | should appear on one line, the entries on one or several lines below but each of those lines must start with at least two spaces, and the entries should be separated by commas. You need not check whether the entries are actually cited in the paper or not: just add them to the nocite metadata, it will not hurt if they are also cited. Continue searching for \\cite commands in your .bib file and make sure all the keys are entered in your document’s nocite metadata section. 19.3 Adding non-cited references in the bibliography In the metadata block, add a line: nocite: | @bibtexentry1, @bibtexentry2, @bibtexentry3 If you have lots of those, best use a tool to extract the keys automatically from a bibtex file. 19.4 Inserting Citations in the text in RStudio Requires: RStudio visual editor mode. In visual mode, Insert &gt; @ Citation. It opens a popup window; on its left menu, choose bibliography. Click the plus sign on the right of each citation, then press the insert button. Missing references: Go to @ Citations. On the left menu of the pop-up window, choose CrossRef. (See image below). Type the author and the name of the paper in the search bar; that should find the paper. Click on the plus sign on the right of the entry, then press insert button which will add the reference to the bibliography file. 19.5 Formatting citations in the text There are various formats of citations: In several recent papers, this has all been shown wrong (Castor &gt; 2018; Pollux 2020). As Castor (2020: 127) shows, this is all wrong. To get these various formats you need to modify the markdown code for citations. For instructions refer to the Markdown guide above (cheatsheet or section on citations). 19.6 BibTeX file guidelines This only applies to BibTeX (.bib) files. If you’re using CSL Json files, you are probably generating them from Zotero or some other bibliography manager instead. 19.6.1 Edit BibTeX files Several methods: Edit the .bib file directly in a text editor (e.g. RStudio). Either: fix manually what is wrong with the entry. delete the entry, search and add it again with the same method as when you miss a reference (see below). Use a BibTeX editor (BibDesk, comes with TeXshop on Macos, or JabRef). Use a bibliography manager like Zotero that imports / exports BibTeX files. Beware: Zotero and others convert the .bib file into their own formats on import. This means that you may lose of your bib file’s features: with Zotero, \\cite commands (that a BibTeX file may use to cite some entries in other entries) are lost. 19.6.2 Check BibTeX file formatting You can use biber (LaTeX’s bibliography generator) to check a BibTeX file for errors. Run on the terminal: biber --tool references.bib This prints out a report on any problem in the file. It also creates a cleaned-up version of the file, as references_bibtools.bib. 19.6.3 BibTeX field names aren’t case-sensitive BibTeX field names are not case-sensitive: they can be named “author”, or “Author”, or “AUTHOR”. @inbook{Jakobson:1980, Author = {Jakobson, Roman}, Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem} } Is the same as: @inbook{Jakobson:1980, author = {Jakobson, Roman}, TITLE = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem} } 19.6.4 Title capitalization Traditionally, in English bibliographies titles in English are typeset in title case (“An Article with Results”) but titles in other languages are typeset in sentence case (“An article with results”). In German or French bibliographies, all titles (including those of works in English) are in sentence case.12 The appearance is controlled by our bibliography template. For this to work entries in the the BibTeX file must: Have a langid field specifying the entry’s language as an IETF language tag: en, en-US, de, etc.13 Though (at least some) full names like english or french will work too. If there is no langid field for a given BibTeX entry, the entry is assumed to be in the language of the document (as specified in the document’s metadata, lang field). Have titles in sentence case, that is, where only names and words that need to be capitalized no matter what are in upper case. For instance, “The philosophy of logical atomism” or “Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen”. If an entry uses title case (“Rezension der Schrift von…”), the capitals will be assumed to be mandatory and will be printed even when it should be in sentence case. Thus if you know that your bibliography entries in English will always be printed in title case (i.e., your publication is in English and you’re sure it won’t adopt the APA sentence case convention), then it’s harmless to use title case in the BibTeX file itself. But when in doubt sentence case + langid field is the safe option. For an illustration: @article{Tarski1936, author = {Alfred Tarski}, title = {Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen}, journal = {Studia Philosophica}, volume = {1}, pages = {261--405}, year = {1936}, langid = {de}, } @article{Russell1905, author = {Bertrand Russell}, title = {On denoting}, journal = {Mind}, volume = {14}, number = {56}, pages = {479--493}, year = {1905}, langid = {en}, } For more detail: the langid field is a biblatex field name. It is recognized by Pandoc’s citeproc (Pandoc’s internal citation processor) for use in a association with a CSL style file. There is a language field in BibTeX files too. But it is not meant to affect an entry’s format; rather, it is used for entries to explicitly state its language](ttps://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/323441/how-does-langid-field-in-biblatex-differ-from-language-field) affect the formal of the bibliography. 19.6.5 Original year of publication If the author isn’t using the original edition of a book, e.g. citing from a 2010 edition of Locke’s 1689 essay, add a field origdate in the bibtex entry. (will not show up in the PDF at the moment, but our final template will do it). Ex: @inbook{Jakobson:1980, Author = {Jakobson, Roman}, Booktitle = {The Framework of Language}, Location = {Ann Arbor}, Year = {1980} Origdate = {1956}, Pages = {81\\--92}, Publisher = {University of Michigan Press}, Shorttitle = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem}, Title = {Metalanguage as a Linguistic Problem} } See biblatex documentation, §2.2.2 on data fields. 19.6.6 BibTeX conventions and resources There are two BibTeX standards that can be used: BibTeX BibLaTeX The two conventions overlap a lot (most of the field names are common). The BibLaTeX conventions are more recent and complete. The BibTeX ones are widely used, and almost entirely compatible with BibLaTeX. Each corresponds to a LaTeX bibliography processor (bibtex and biber, respectively). Both are understood by Pandoc’s bibliography processor, citeproc. Where to find references on these BibTeX standards? BibTeX. The BibTeX original documentation (1988), Paperpile’s BibTeX guide. BibLaTeX. The BibLaTeX official documentation and the BibLaTeX cheatsheet. Note: if you have a full LaTeX installation on your computer you will have access to some of these documents from your terminal using the texdoc command. Try the commands: texdoc biblatex texdoc biblatex-cheatsheet texdoc bibtex Dialectica guideline. We use the biblatex conventions. 19.7 BibTeX file special entry types 19.7.1 Unpublished manuscript Choose the type unpublished. Add a note field: note = {unpublished manuscript} Add a URL if available. Dialectica guideline. We require a URL. If the author cannot provide a URL, we do not create a bibliography entry at all but only describe the source in a footnote (“in an unpublished manuscript titled”XXX”). 19.8 Troubleshooting and examples 19.8.1 Error message: Unexpected end of file The following message indicates an error with the BibTeX file: Error at &quot;percent.bib&quot; (line 9, column 1): unexpected end of input 19.8.2 Percent signs in DOI field At the moment % signs in DOI fields generate an error. If you copied/pasted DOIs in your BibTeX file, symbols in them may end up ‘percent-encoded’, e.g. “%2F” instead of “/”. For instance, the DOI “10.1007/15.12345” copied from the web may end up being pasted as “10.1007%2F15.12345”. These DOIs crash Pandoc version 3.0.1 and lower, but the bug will be fixed in future releases. 19.8.3 Error message: \\citet unknown command Requires: script or filter that manages recursive bibliography management . Pandoc encounters a LaTeX citation command (\\citet or the like). Unless you or the author has written one in the text, it is in the .bib file.14 Solution 1. In Dialectica, LaTeX citation commands in the .bib file are processed. This is achieved by a script that runs pandoc on the document twice, first to generate a json that includes the biblio, second to generate the final output (at which state the latex commands in the biblio are processed). The first run is --to json and the second with -M suppress-bibliography. Suggested by John MacFarlane on pandoc-discuss. Solution 1. Replace the offending \\citet command(s) in your .bib file. To find it or them: process the markdown with .tex output. search \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in. go to the .bib file and replace the \\citet{jones_a:2020} in that entry with e.g. Jones (2020), and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above) Solution 2. Implement a double-pass generation procedure. This is the publisher’s job. We have now figured out a method to process those command. However, we’ll need to update the document-generation procedure to implement it. Either wait for it, or use solution 1. in a field of your .bib file is printed out. It needs to be replaced. To find it: process the markdown with .tex output. search \\citet in the tex output. you should see which bib entry it is in. go to the .bib file and replace the \\citet{jones_a:2020} in that entry with e.g. Jones (2020), and in the md, enter the citation key as no-cite (see above) Explanation. Pandoc doesn’t process it (at least, not if the field is “title”, and perhaps not in general), leaves the \\citet command. At the LaTeX stage it’s not recognized by LaTeX (because we don’t load natbib). 19.8.4 From Frege to gödel Mystery. The cross ref below is printed out as “From Frege to gödel:” by citeproc, no matter (a) whether we write Gödel or G{\\¨o}del, (b) no matter the position, i.e. we get “From gödel to Frege”. The solution is put G in curly brackets. But why??? \\@incollection{frege:1967a, Author = {Frege, Gottlob}, Crossref = {vanheijenoort:1967}, Note = {translated by Stephan Bauer-Mengelberg}, Num_Sort = {40337}, Pages = {1\\--82}, Title = {Begriffsschrift: A Formula Language Modeled on that of Arithmetic, for Pure Thought}, Year = {1967} } \\@book{vanheijenoort:1967, editor = {van Heijenoort, Jan}, year = {1967}, title = {From Frege to G{\\&quot;o}del: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic 1879-1931}, booktitle = {From Frege to {G}ödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic 1879-1931}, address = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},publisher = {Harvard University Press} } Beginning of an answer: case is protected if a subpart of the word is bracketed. A dog called {Pizza} will be overriding by the style (and thus printed “A pizza” if the style calls for it) but A dog called {P}izza is protected. The Chicago manual recommends title case for English titles; the APA manual recommends sentence case for all titles.↩︎ The polyglossia package documentation has a useful list of tags. If you have a full LaTeX installation you can also get it from the terminal by running the command texdoc polyglossia.↩︎ Explanation. By default Pandoc doesn’t process the \\citet command in a bib file (at least, not if the field is “title”, and perhaps not in general), leaves the \\citet command.

A bug in one of the “filters” that we use to handle various typesetting tasks (e.g. statements). You will see the name lua in the error message. Faulty LaTeX template. Cannot compile the template error. There’s an error in the house template. LaTeX stage errors are due to a multitude of causes. You can learn more about the error by running your pdf engine on the LaTeX output: lualatex article.tex For lualatex; replace with pdflatex or xelatex depending on your setup. Once you run LaTeX a detailed log of its action rolls out—faster than you can read. The error message will be close to the end and look like this: Error/Warning (...) Error: MESSAGE Type H &lt;return&gt; for immediate help. ... l.3984 {See the manual for further details.} The l.3984 is the line of the LaTeX file where the error arose. (Not necessarily the line that caused it! The cause might be earlier in the code, though not later.) You can go to that location in your LaTeX file and investigate. You can place the LaTeX run log in a file if you want to examine it in a text editor rather than the terminal: lualatex article.tex &gt; latex_log.txt 21.2 Word manuscript with many symbols (phi, psy, greek letters, logical symbols,). If the symbols aren’t in MS Word Equations, they will be preserved as is in markdown - and the document won’t work. All the symbols have to converted into LaTeX formulas. A tip: Use search and replace in RStudio to convert each symbol in its &gt; LaTeX equivalent.

Check whether the relative locations of your article, master and template are correct. File not found in resource path Pandoc is looking for a file with no name. Check if you don’t have an emtpy bibliography field in the metadata. 21.5 Missing character [WARNING] Missing character: There is no SPECIAL-CHAR (U+2192) in font FONT Means that your markdown file include a character SPECIAL-CHAR that is not available in the font you use. Typically, SPECIAL-CHAR is a symbol or character from non-latin languages. Note that you might not see anything where SPECIAL-CHAR is above, if the character in question is a (special kind of) space or if it’s not present in the font in which this warning is printed. Solution: if SPECIAL-CHAR is visible you can copy it, and search it in your markdown file. Remove it and if needed replace it with some character that is present in your font. Typically, this involves replacing a unicode symbol (a right arrow) by its LaTeX equivalent, e.g. \\(\\rightarrow\\). Solution: if SPECIAL-CHAR is not visible, look up the unicode number (e.g. U+2192 online) to see what character is it, and hunt it down in your markdown manuscript. 21.6 YAML Parse exepction Error message: PandocParseError \"YAML parse exception at line 2, column 2:\\nmapping values are not allowed in this context\" Solution: this is probably due to several --- lines in your source markdown. The text in between might be interpreted as an additional YAML metadata block by Pandoc. Replace them with a longer dash sequence, e.g ------. 21.7 attempt to compare nil with number Error: warning (node filter): error: ...e/2022/texmf-dist/tex/generic/babel/babel-bid i-basic.lua:155: attempt to compare nil with number This bug can be produced by a statement with a custom label containing an uppercase letter followed by a dash, such as: ::: statement __L-a__. This statement might generate an error! ::: Fix. Surround the dash with spaces ::: statement __L - a__. This will not generate an error. ::: A longer dash probably looks better: ::: statement __L -- a__. This will not generate an error. ::: 21.8 A list of things that cause trouble Some hurdles that beginning copyeditors typically face. 21.8.1 Visual editor RStudio Does not preserve numbered examples code (all processed). Tables: Doesn’t preserve code (not pipe format -&gt; loss of cell &gt; alignment) Interprets \\\\[ and \\\\\\] as display maths. Solution: do not escape the \\[ \\]. Only possible problem: it &gt; picks up a section label. But I think you can change the title &gt; in section labels. 21.8.2 Pandoc LaTeX encoding of tables is heavy (every cell is a minipage! &gt; Specifies detailed widths) Tables: no colspan nor rowspan yet Indented blocks (statements, arguments, …) and AMS theorems HTML default encoding of formulas uses unicode + italics + “math &gt; inline” custom style class.

The aim is to generate all automatically from a single source. There are two ways to do this: XML. markdown. XML is the industry standard. But it is costly to work with (proprietary tools). markdown is a lighter-weight, popular authoring language. pandoc is a powerful converter that turns a large number of formats into markdown and conversely. It can be harnessed to produce outputs in all formats, including XML. 25.2 MS Word - Google docs workflow (to be elaborated on!) Clean the MS word document using our tool: https://dialectica-philosophy.herokuapp.com/pandoc Clean the MS word document Import it in Google Docs and edit it there, keeping all and only the meaningful elements (there’s a list in the document I’ll share). Don’t bother with fixing references at this stage. Save a snapshot of your document before you send it to the author. Share the edited document with the author, ask whether they’re happy with any modifications. You can activate the ‘track changes’ in google docs to make any major modifications visible to the author. Review the author changes, and once you and they are happy pass it on to the markdown team. To check: what edits are preserved in markdown: Cross References done with link &amp; bookmark in google doc 25.3 Markdown workflow The accepted papers will be in either .doc, .docx (Word) or .tex (LaTeX) format. First we convert doc and tex files to markdown files (.md). Then we do all the editing using RStudio, a visual markdown editor (for steps on editing, see next paragraph). Once the edits are done, the file is converted into a pdf which is sent back to the author for questions and / or for a final approval. If there are more changes, they are done again in the markdown file, and the final version is again converted into a pdf, then sent to the author for final approval. Once the final version is approved, we use Pandoc to convert the markdown file into a pdf (via LaTeX, which will have the determined style template) and html. Editing consists of: Editing the language (correct typos, bad English, strange sentences) Preserve and implement meaningful elements: headings, block quotations, formulas, … . Check that the bibliography is correct: that every citation has a reference in the bibliography. Replace manually added citations by automatic ones (for Word files, the bibliography needs to be converted into a Bibtex file with a website that is yet to be developed. Latex papers will already have a Bibtex file). Once all the changes are done, send the paper to the author for possible questions and to have their approval of the changes. 25.4 Interaction with authors Title + abstract. Remind authors that most online searches will only &gt; return title and abstract. Most potential readers won’t get &gt; further. They are advised to choose their title and abstract well.

The family name of the author(s), “Abstract”, “References” and the family names of cited authors in the “References” section are in small caps. After the family name, the affiliation is given by “Postal address or University Affiliation, Email: email address”. No keywords are required. New paragraphs begin with a feeder, except after section titles, quotes and formulas. Longer citations are left- and right-indented and in smaller font. This replaces quotation marks. There is a small space before and after indented material. Authors should use a simple uniform layout. They should avoid mixing fonts and use italics (not bold) for words or phrases requiring emphasis, for variables and schematic letters not appearing in formulae, for titles of published books and journals, and for foreign words. The journal name dialectica is in italics and not capitalised. All diagrams should be professionally drawn and saved as camera-ready GIF-, TIF- or JPG-file. We recommend that you consult the illustration guidelines at http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/illustration.asp. Whenever authors use special characters (e.g. in formulae), they are asked to provide the required fonts. LaTeX dialectica accepts submissions and final manuscripts set in LaTeX. Please make the source file as simple and self-contained as possible and provide special fonts et al. Please also send a pdf version of the print-out. References Bibliographical references should appear in the text (rather than in footnotes) in the form: (James, 1972) or (Smith et al. 1938, 173-174). All bibliographical references must be repeated at the end of the text under the heading “References”. The list should begin with the author’s last name, initials and followed by the year of publication, whenever possible according to the following style: Bunge, M. 1967a, Scientific Research I: The Search for System, Berlin: Springer Bunge, M. 1967b, Scientific Research II: The Search for Truth, Berlin: Springer Dretske, F. and Snyder, A. 1972, “Causal Irregularity”, Philosophy of Science 39, pp. 69-71 Harding, S.

WE NOW GET OUR .BIBs FROM PHILIPP, WHO PROVIDES THEM WHILE WE WORK OUT A NEW WAY OF PRODUCING THEM. If the manuscript is in TeX, ask the author for the BibTeX file. If the manuscript is in Word, you have three solutions: The easiest way: You can use Sandro’s bibtex &gt; generator: Copy the references from the word file,15 enter your email into &gt; the bar below and submit. The .bib file is sent as email. Save the .bib file in the same folder as the article, because that &gt; is where RStudio will look for it. Add the name of the .bib file into the metadata block and save the &gt; article (the .md file), which will add the .bib file and allow you &gt; to insert citations. Check that the references have all the information. You may have to &gt; fix / add manually some of the references (instructions &gt; here). Create it manually beforehand: by pulling the entries from Philipp’s master bibliography (in the &gt; Dropbox dialectica/bibliography-in_work/biblio-check.bib, or from &gt; the spreadsheet if you prefer &gt; dialectica/bibliography-in_work/biblio-check.ods). By searching each entry on Philpapers, bookmarking it in a &gt; ‘collection’, and exporting the collection as BibTex Add them as you edit the file, by searching them using &gt; RStudio’s citation tool. Note: you can use dashes in your bib file name (references-final.bib) but don’t use underscores (references_final.bib). In conversion from RStudio they are escaped so it because “references\\_final.bib” in the tex file and the bibliography isn’t found. If several entries from the same author are formatted with a long dash (---, 2019), you can still paste as is. Replacing the dash with the author name may slightly improve a few of results, but (for some reason not clear to me) worsen a few others; overall it only seems marginally better.↩︎ "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
